It is essential for earlier diagnosis of COVID-19 and timely medical intervention. To perform experiment, 80% of dataset is chosen for training whereas 20% is assigned for testing purpose.\\n\\nExperimental setup and dataset\\n\\nThis section illustrates the two datasets considered for experimentation purpose. Datasets chosen for experimentation purpose have no missing values, up to date and accurate. Both datasets are open-source and are available.\\n\\nBrazilian dataset (SARS-COV2 CT scan dataset)\\n\\nThe SARS CT scan dataset comprises of 2482 CT scans of 120 patients which includes 1252 CT scans of 60 infected patients and 1230 CT images of 60 patients which were non-infected shown in Fig. 4. The data was gathered from real patients from hospital in Sao-Paulo, Brazil hospitals.\\n\\nFigure 4 (1): examples of 3D CT scan images that are COVID positive (Left) and (2) non-COVID-19 (Right) from SARS_CoV2 Data-set. (3)Examples of 3D CT scan images that are COVID positive (Left) and (4) non-COVID-19 (Right) from Hust19 Data-set. (5) Examples of 3D CT scan images that are COVID positive (Left) and (6) non-COVID-19 (Right) from COVIDx Data-set. Full size image\\n\\nCT Scan Images varies in image size such as image of small size consist of 104 \\u00d7 153 dimension and larger image comprises of 484 \\u00d7 416 dimension. The dataset contains heterogenous CT scan images having low number of instances. In additions, CT scan images are of different contrast and resolution. This open source dataset is available on https://www.kaggle.com/plameneduardo/sarscov2-ctscan-dataset. Basic purpose of this dataset was to promote development and research of artificial intelligent methods that are able to determine person infected by SARS-CoV-2 using CT scans. In case of SARS-CoV-2 CT-scan dataset (Brazilian dataset) necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals was obtained.\\n\\nHust19 dataset\\n\\nHust19 is multiclass dataset comprises of three types of CT slices such as Non_informative CT (NiCT), Postive CT (pCT) and Negative Ct (nCT). NiCT contains 5705 scan images which have no information about lung parenchyma whereas pCT includes 4001 CT scan images that contains imaging features related to COVID-19 pneumonia shown in Fig. 4. The third type of Hust19 dataset, negative (nCT) comprises of 9979 CT images which were not related to COVID19 pneumonia. The HUST19 CT scan data-set comprises of 19,685 CT scan slices. Dataset is open source and is available on https://bioengineeringcommunity.nature.com/posts/hust-19-for-predicting-covid-19-clinical-outcomes. Hust19 was made available under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license. Hust19 was accumulated from lab of union hospital, Wuhan. It contains number of chest CT (computed tomography) images and clinical features from patients having or without COVID-19.\\n\\nComparison with state-of-the-art methods\\n\\nThe performance of proposed method is evaluated by comparing it with existing methods. Details on the performance evaluation of Brazilian Datasets are presented in Fig. 5a. To evaluate the proposed method performance, 80% of dataset is used for training while 20% is hold out for testing purpose. Several parameters are considered for experimental evaluation. Patch size of 10 \\u00d7 10, 200 number of epochs and input image resolution of 300 \\u00d7 300 was considered for comparing the proposed method with state of art methods. By increasing the input image size, patch size and resolution of image on HUST19 dataset, results in increase in accuracy of our approach as shown in Fig. 5b,c. Whereas, number of epochs have no significant effect on proposed approach accuracy. Figure 5b reveals that when patch size of 10 is employed, AUC value is 0.966 whereas AUC tends to increase to 0.977 when patch size of 12 is used as shown in Fig. 5c.\\n\\nFigure 5 Performance evaluation of proposed vision transformer based approach (a): results on Brazilian dataset (b) results on Hust19 Data-sets using patch size 10 (c) results on Hust19 Data-sets using patch size 12. Full size image\\n\\nDifferent methods are utilized for comparison propose such as VGG16, Inceptionv3 and Resnet50. We train the network for 200 epochs, and network is tested with test set in each epoch. There are 12 number of steps in each epoch. All the methods are evaluated with accuracy metric which allows us to make performance comparison with two CT scan images datasets.\\n\\nFor binary classification (COVID, Non-COVID) on Brazilian Dataset, the test accuracy of Resnet50, InceptionV3, VGG16 is 90.0%, 82.0%, and 81.0%, respectively. AUROC of three ensemble classifiers are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. These classifiers are applied on Brazilian and Hust19 dataset that shows better performance on Brazilian Dataset. However, AUROC of GradientBoost and voting based classifier reveals good performance in case of Hust19 dataset as well. Ada-boost, Gradient-boosting, voting classifiers achieved 84%, 96.0%, and 97.0% accuracy on Hust19 dataset respectively. It has been revealed from experimentation that loss value using the proposed ViT based approach is less as compared to state of art methods. The precision recall value on different classes of Hust19 dataset are shown in Fig. 5b revealing model good performance on two classes. Less precision and recall value of class 2 could be because of a smaller number of instances were available to train the model. Furthermore, resultant accuracy on hust19 dataset is 99.6%. The number of transformer layers, patch size and image resolution have an impact on precision recall curve. Proposed approach achieved 94% accuracy by using the image resolution of (150 \\u00d7 150) and patch size of 6. We trained the models with 200 epochs, learning rate of (1 \\u00d7 e \\u2212 3), batch size of 156, patch size of 10, transformer layers of 8 and image resolution was set to (300 \\u00d7 300) results in 98% accuracy on Brazilian and 99.6% accuracy on Hust19 dataset.\\n\\nFigure 6 Performance evaluation of ensemble classifier on Hust19 Data-set (a) AdaBoost (b) GradientBoost (c) voting-based classifier. Full size image\\n\\nFigure 7 Performance evaluation of ensemble classifier on Brazilian Data-set (a) AdaBoost (b) GradientBoost (c) voting-based classifier. Full size image\\n\\nTo compare models\\u2019 performances on multi-class dataset (Hust19), and to show the proposed technique effectiveness, we calculated the overall precision, recall and accuracy. The results are illustrated in Figs. 6 and 8. The ensemble classifiers, Ada-Boost, Gradient-Boosting and Voting based classifiers have achieved accuracy of 81%, 99.0%, and 95.0% respectively. While on the contrary, deep learning-based classifiers, VGG16, Resnet50 and InceptionV3 results in 96%, 97.0%, and 97.9% accuracy. Figure 9 shows the results of deep learning classifiers (VGG16, InceptionV3, Resnet50) on Brazilian dataset.\\n\\nFigure 8 Performance evaluation of deep learning classifier on Hust19 Data-set. Full size image\\n\\nFigure 9 Performance evaluation of deep learning classifier on Brazilian Data-set. Full size image\\n\\nThe highest accuracy 99.6% on multi-class dataset is achieved by our proposed approach. Compared to the current deep learning based and ensemble classifiers, proposed ViT based approach has achieved better accuracy, suggesting that self-attention transformer using CT Scan images could be a reliable method in recognizing and detecting COVID-19 patients. Table 1 presents the accuracy of proposed approach, ensemble, and deep learning-based classifiers on binary and multi-class dataset. In Hust19 dataset, number of instances belonging to third class is very low as compared to other classes. Image variation in this dataset is also low and number of instances belonging to each variation are high that help the classifiers to achieve better accuracy.\\n\\nTable 1 Accuracy of classifiers on binary and multi-class data-set. Full size table\\n\\nComparison with existing studies\\n\\nA comparison of proposed approach is performed with existing studies as well. There are several studies utilizing Brazilian and Hust19 dataset to diagnose the COVID-19 as illustrated in Table 2. In one of the research studies, a machine learning based algorithms was developed33 to diagnose COVID-19. Several machine learning models such as artificial neural networks, random forests, extra trees, gradient boosting and catboost were employed on Brazilian Dataset. All the models performed well, results in area under curve higher than achieved 92% and 82% sensitivity and specificity value respectively. In the proposed approach, tenfold cross validation was also performed. In another research study34, a voting-based approach was used for COVID-19 diagnosis. The proposed approach was applied on Brazilian dataset results in achieving accuracy and precision value of 87% and 99% respectively. In this approach, a cross dataset validation was also performed which illustrated that accuracy drops from 87 to 56%.\\n\\nTable 2 Accuracy of classifiers on binary and multi-class data-set. Full size table\\n\\nFurthermore, xDNN was also applied in35 to diagnose the COVID-19 and Brazilian dataset, collected from different hospitals of Brazil was used for testing purpose. Moreover, xDNN classifier demonstrates good results in terms of explainable for detection of COVID-19 using CT slices. Furthermore, it also gives explanation using IF. THEN rules on actual CT scan images. The proposed approach35 achieved 97.38% accuracy. For detection of COVID-19, another approach36 utilized convolutional neural network and ConvLSTM. Approach was tested on two types of datasets which includes X-Ray and Brazilian CT scan images. In addition, pneumonia and COVID-19 image categories were classified for validation of approach36. Approach36 achieved an accuracy of 99% which reveals that it can be considered for quick screening of COVID-19. Table 2 demonstrate the results of existing classifiers for COVID-19 diagnosis. Table 2 demonstrate the results of existing classifiers for COVID-19 diagnosis. Our proposed vision-based transformer approach take 1 s per step in epochs for COVID-19 diagnosis.\\n\\nCross-corpus data-set validation\\n\\nFor this experiment, we examine the impact of training model on one dataset and testing it on another one. The Hust19 dataset is first used only for training and for testing the model, Brazilian dataset is used. We also evaluated another scenario such as using Brazilian dataset for training the model and Hust19 is used as a test set. The result of this scenario showed a decline in the model performance as can be seen in Fig. 10, and one of the possible reasons behind this behaviour can be variation in images. The model could find out the patterns of one image indicating COVID-19 existence, but these may not seem in another dataset. Training on Hust19 and testing Brazilian dataset showed worse results since Hust19 training set is not like Brazilian dataset. Since vision transformer model poorly generalize on small dataset that could be a reason in worse performance when cross corpus data-set validation is performed.\\n\\nFigure 10 (a) Cross dataset Results (Train Brazilian & Test Hust19) (b) Cross dataset Results (Train Hust19 & Test Brazilian) (c) Cross dataset Results (Train Hust19 & Test COVIDx CT). Full size image\\n\\nAs we can see in Fig. 10c, precision and recall value of performing cross corpus between Hust19 and Brazilian dataset decreases rapidly although it was quite good in case of COVIDx CT dataset. Because Hust19 and COVIDx CT datasets are quite similar whereas Brazilian dataset was totally different from both datasets. Variation in images is high as compared to other datasets and number of images belonging to each variation are quite low. In case of training the model using Hust19 dataset and testing s performed using COVIDx dataset, proposed approach achieved accuracy of 94% which is higher than the existing studies29,30,31 having accuracy of 83.6% on Hust19 and 90% on their own dataset.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "'A lesser known but equally crucial dimension in managing and responding to an epidemic is social sciences in health, which can shed light on populations\\' understanding, perception and acceptance of the risks associated with diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic is no exception. As the disease spread across the planet, clear differences in perception by populations were observed in different countries, creating fertile ground for investigation for researchers specializing in social sciences applied to health.\\n\\nSocial sciences are a series of academic disciplines (anthropology, sociology, communication, economics, etc.) whose common thread is the study of human societies and social interactions between individuals, groups and their environments.\\n\\nDuring the Ebola epidemic in 2015, healthcare procedures and safe burial management went against certain cultural and religious practices, creating very high levels of mistrust among populations regarding healthcare interventions and those responsible for them. Social sciences in health became an essential factor in the successful management of the Ebola epidemic: research into the perception and degree of acceptability of certain treatments and practices by a given population was used as a basis for dialog with the aim of organizing the most appropriate response to specific needs and contexts.\\n\\nThe importance of giving population groups a say in their perceptions of the COVID-19 epidemic\\n\\nFor the past twenty years, researchers in social sciences have been looking into issues related to epidemic preparedness and response (especially perceptions: of disease, testing, social distancing measures and vaccination, the impact of misinformation or rumors, etc.) and providing support to health authorities in developing responses to potential disease outbreaks. Initial research focused on social issues related to people with HIV: perception, stigmatization, adherence to treatment, etc.\\n\\nStudies in the area of social sciences in health are mainly carried out nationwide, but it can be worthwhile expanding their scope to a larger scale. The aim of the REPAIR program (International Pasteurian Research Program in Response to Coronavirus in Africa) conducted since 2020 in 10 African institutes in the Pasteur Network is to improve understanding of SARS-CoV-2 circulation on the African continent. The social sciences part of the project particularly focuses on testing and the way in which it is understood and experienced by three categories of people in four countries: healthcare professionals, individuals who have been tested and the general population.\\n\\nThe REPAIR project applies the same research protocol to four members of the Pasteur Network (Côte d\\'Ivoire, Madagascar, Niger and Tunisia) with different environments and political, epidemiological and cultural contexts, with the aim of performing a comparative socio-anthropological study.\\n\\n\"It is crucial to have a common framework within which to draft guidelines for health authorities, but we have given ourselves a degree of flexibility to take account of national particularities,\" explains Dr. Chiarella Mattern, Head of the Health and Social Sciences group within the Epidemiology and Clinical Research Unit at the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar in charge of the social sciences component of the REPAIR project.\\n\\nThe aim of the study is to collect qualitative data through in-depth interviews with those affected by the issues at hand.\\n\\nEach institute (CERMES Niger, Institut Pasteur de Côte d\\'Ivoire, Institut Pasteur de Madagascar and Institut Pasteur de Tunis) interviewed three groups of people: healthcare workers, people who had been tested, and the general population. Healthcare workers shared their experience of COVID-19, healthcare practices, difficulties encountered in tackling the disease, vaccination and the impact of the epidemic on their daily lives. People who had been tested spoke about their understanding and perception of testing. The interviews with the general population will provide data on knowledge about COVID-19, the application and practice of screening, and experiences of the preventive measures introduced by the different governments.\\n\\nThe Institut Pasteur de Madagascar, the Institut Pasteur de Côte d\\'Ivoire and the Institut Pasteur de Tunis have now finished gathering data and are in the data entry phase. CERMES Niger is slightly further ahead and is drafting an initial report.\\n\\nThese data can only be fully understood when seen within the respective national contexts of the epidemic. Each of the four institutes has therefore agreed to produce a timeline of major events (border closures, dates of lockdowns, etc.), compiled using press reviews and an analysis of speeches by health authorities. All the results will be published in summer 2022.\\n\\nThe first network for social sciences in health in the Pasteur Network\\n\\nJust two institutes in the Pasteur Network have a structured team in social sciences applied to health: the Institut Pasteur in Paris and the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar. Over the past ten years, several research projects in health humanities have been developed within the Pasteur Network, touching on a wide variety of topics: maternal and infant health, infectious diseases, etc.\\n\\nThe REPAIR project, which has a dedicated social sciences component, has provided an opportunity to formalize this working framework. It is crucial that all health humanities researchers, most of whom are isolated in their countries, can get to know their counterparts in the Pasteur Network and develop a network of expertise.\\n\\nInitially, the aim is to identify key people, to determine individual needs (training, networking, etc.) and to share experiences (research topics, funding bodies, partners, methodologies used). On this basis, the idea is then to form a structured network of researchers in social sciences applied to health within the Pasteur Network, so as to boost opportunities to develop research by fostering a stimulating environment for scientific dialog on shared research questions.\\n\\n\"In recent years, the outbreaks of Ebola, plague in Madagascar in 2017, and COVID-19 have highlighted the importance of our discipline in terms of preparedness and response to the social dimensions of epidemics, especially the need to analyze the factors governing the success or failure of public health interventions and to analyze rumors and the demand for care. Given the impact that individual health-related behaviors can have on the success of public health interventions, it is crucial to incorporate anthropological research into work on epidemic preparedness and response, and in health research in general,\" concludes Dr. Mattern.'"
