We say this because symptoms which seemed strange at first, like the loss of taste or Covid tongue, are becoming fairly common. In fact, a study reported that around 25 per cent of the patients diagnosed with coronavirus had symptoms related to the oral area.\\n\\nAccording to a research letter published in the British Journal of Dermatology, there are many patients who have reported the development of bumps on their tongue. These bumps are accompanied by inflammation and swelling in the region.\\n\\nBut, what really causes this Covid tongue?\\n\\nWell, it\\u2019s the receptors present on your tongue. Basically, our body has ACE receptors which are found in abundance on the tongue. So, when we are hit by the virus, our body defends itself this way.\\n\\nThe tongue getting affected isn\\u2019t unique to coronavirus and has been reported by those suffering from other viral infections as well. It is, however, gaining more recognition as a symptom due to now being associated with the widely-discussed coronavirus.\\n\\nApart from Covid tongue, here are 4 oral manifestations of COVID-19\\n\\n1. First and foremost, it\\u2019s the loss of taste which is the most common oral symptom that the majority of the patients report. In fact, some individuals reported that this particular symptom was experienced by them even after testing negative for the novel virus.\\n\\n2. The second one is bruxism. This means grinding the teeth and can also be experienced due to stress. According to an article published in The New York Times, it\\u2019s causing more serious issues such as cracked teeth and fractures.\\n\\n3. Bleeding and oral inflammation is increasingly being reported by those diagnosed with coronavirus.\\n\\n4. Another symptom that is common when suffering from coronavirus is experiencing cotton mouth or dry mouth. Now, this could be due to various reasons. Those who have coronavirus might find it hard to breathe and perform the function through their mouth. This makes the mouth dry.\\n\\nCoronavirus also interferes with the function of salivary glands, causing dry mouth. According to experts, this novel virus attacks our salivary glands and reduces the production of saliva.\\n\\nSo, stay alert about any such changes. If you\\u2019ve been experiencing any of the oral health-related symptoms mentioned here, you should talk to a doctor at the earliest.\",\n          \"Dylan O'Brien has tested positive for COVID-19.\\n\\nThe Maze Runner actor, 30, revealed his diagnosis on Twitter Monday, writing that he was \\\"all good\\\" and \\\"experiencing mild symptoms.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Being vaxxed & boosted (and having it with Obama) is v much helping,\\\" said O'Brien, referring to former President Barack Obama's recent COVID-19 diagnosis.\\n\\nThe star went on to share that he \\\"had to cancel [the] rest of press\\\" \\u2014 seemingly for his new film The Outfit \\u2014 as a result of his illness.\\n\\n\\\"Sobering reminder that we're still in a pandemic,\\\" O'Brien added, signing off with, \\\"Stay safe be mindful x.\\\"\\n\\nNever miss a story \\u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human-interest stories.\\n\\nRELATED GALLERY: Celebrities Who've Tested Positive for COVID in 2021\\n\\nO'Brien previously reunited with several of his former Maze Runner castmates at the start of the pandemic in the U.S., over video chat.\\n\\nThe meetup took place on March 31, 2020, when O'Brien was joined virtually by costars including Kaya Scodelario (Teresa), Will Poulter (Gally), Ki Hong Lee (Minho), Dexter Darden (Frypan) and Thomas Brodie-Sangster (Newt).\\n\\nScodelario, 30, shared a screenshot from the reunion on Instagram, throwing some slight shade at the third film in the science-fiction franchise, which debuted in 2018 to less-than-favorable reviews.\\n\\n\\\"We survived the Glade, the Scorch & whatever the third one was about.

But lying awake at night, during the peak of sickness or in the weeks or months following an infection, some people discover another downside: They can\\u2019t sleep.\\n\\n\\u201cWe see it all the time,\\u201d said Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, the chief of research and development at the V.A. St. Louis Healthcare System. Here\\u2019s why Covid can be so disruptive to your sleep, along with tips for getting enough rest.\\n\\nWhy Covid affects sleep\\n\\nOne theory is based in biology: In some people with Covid infections, the virus may be able to get into the hypothalamus \\u2014 a key part of the brain for regulating sleep, said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. Any area of the body that the virus enters, it can inflame, he said; any part that gets inflamed tends to function less well.\\n\\nThis means that even if people linger in bed for eight hours, they may not be getting deep, restorative sleep, Dr. Al-Aly said.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":27}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df = df[[\"published date\",\"texts\"]]"],"metadata":{"id":"IukIH4jAjySV"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df[\"texts\"][99]"],"metadata":{"id":"HwXMMFnvz1_0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1716066281596,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"Ny Haingo Miantsatiana ANDRY","userId":"02576837319316170548"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":140},"outputId":"e2c2ecdd-bdd6-499a-d5ec-2829b0e9724f"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'Headache is said to be one of the most common neurological symptoms of COVID-19 that could linger on even after all the other symptoms have disappeared.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA 2020 study found that out of 130 participants positive with COVID-19, 74.6 percent had mild to moderate headaches.
