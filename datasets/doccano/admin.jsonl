{"id":60844,"text":"What causes delirium in coronavirus patients?","labels":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":62544,"text":"The researchers stress that the most important finding from the study is that the PhenoAge measure had reliable predictive power, even though it was computed ten years or more before the current pandemic appeared, and though it was not connected to either the chronological age or the presence of other disease states.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":62549,"text":"High glucose levels are already known to increase the risk of death in flu patients.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":62550,"text":"Low albumin was also linked to severe COVID-19, as found in many prior studies.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":62551,"text":"This correlation with albumin levels measured more than ten years earlier confirms that the low levels of albumin are due to chronic inflammation, as also shown by a high C-reactive protein (CRP) and leukocyte count, rather than because of reduced albumin production.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":62552,"text":"Despite the current relevance of an aging study that occurred long ago, it could also be that some individuals who had accelerated aging later improved their health, but others showed reverse movement.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":62553,"text":"This would mean that a more recent PhenoAge could improve the predictive value of this measure.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67364,"text":"If you open up an LFT device, you’ll find a strip of paper-like material, called nitrocellulose, and a small red pad, hidden under the plastic casing below the T-line.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67365,"text":"Absorbed to the red pad are antibodies that bind to the COVID-19 virus.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67366,"text":"They are also attached to gold nanoparticles (tiny particles of gold actually appear red), which allow us to see where the antibodies are on the device.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67367,"text":"When you do a test, you mix your sample with a liquid buffer solution, ensuring the sample stays at an optimum pH, before dripping it on the strip.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67368,"text":"Mark Lorch , Author provided","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67369,"text":"The fluid wicks up the nitrocellulose strip and picks up the gold and antibodies.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67370,"text":"The latter also bind to the virus, if present.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67371,"text":"Further up the strip, next to the T (for test), are more antibodies that bind the virus.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67372,"text":"But these antibodies are not free to move – they are stuck to the nitrocellulose.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67373,"text":"As the red smear of gold-labelled antibodies pass this second set of antibodies, these also grab hold of the virus.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67374,"text":"The virus is then bound to both sets of antibodies – leaving everything, including the gold, immobilised on a line next to the T on the device, indicating a positive test.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67375,"text":"Gold antibodies that haven’t bound to the virus carry on up the strip where they meet a third set of antibodies, not designed to pick up COVID-19, stuck at the C (for control) line.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":67377,"text":"This final line is used to indicate the test has worked.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67378,"text":"Acid test","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67379,"text":"So how can a soft drink cause the appearance of a red T line?","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67380,"text":"One possibility is that the drinks contain something that the antibodies recognise and bind to, just as they do to the virus.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67381,"text":"But this is rather unlikely.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67382,"text":"The reason antibodies are used in tests like these is that they are incredibly fussy about what they bind to.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67383,"text":"There’s all sorts of stuff in the snot and saliva collected by the swabs you take from the nose and mouth, and the antibodies totally ignore this mess of protein, other viruses and remains of your breakfast.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67384,"text":"So they aren’t going to react to the ingredients of a soft drink.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67385,"text":"A much more likely explanation is that something in the drinks is affecting the function of the antibodies.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67386,"text":"A range of fluids, from fruit juice to cola, have been used to fool the tests, but they all have one thing in common – they are highly acidic.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67387,"text":"The citric acid in orange juice, phosphoric acid in cola and malic acid in apple juice give these beverages a pH between 2.5 and 4.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67388,"text":"These are pretty harsh conditions for antibodies, which have evolved to work largely within the bloodstream, with its almost neutral pH of about 7.4.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67389,"text":"Maintaining an ideal pH for the antibodies is key to the correct function of the test, and that’s the job of the liquid buffer solution that you mix your sample with, provided with the test.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67390,"text":"The critical role of the buffer is highlighted by the fact that if you mix cola with the buffer – as shown in this debunking of an Austrian politician’s claim that mass testing is worthless – then the LFTs behave exactly as you’d expect: negative for COVID-19.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67391,"text":"So without the buffer, the antibodies in the test are fully exposed to the acidic pH of the beverages.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67392,"text":"And this has a dramatic effect on their structure and function.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67393,"text":"Antibodies are proteins, which are comprised of amino acid building blocks, attached together to form long, linear chains.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67394,"text":"These chains fold up into very specific structures.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67395,"text":"Even a small change to the chains can dramatically impact a protein’s function.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67396,"text":"These structures are maintained by a network of many thousands of interactions between the various parts of the protein.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67397,"text":"For example, negatively charged parts of a protein will be attracted to positively charged areas.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67398,"text":"But in acidic conditions, the protein becomes increasingly positively charged.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67399,"text":"As a result, many of the interactions that hold the protein together are disrupted, the delicate structure of the protein is affected and it no longer functions correctly.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67400,"text":"In this case, the antibodies’ sensitivity to the virus is lost.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67401,"text":"Given this, you might expect that the acidic drinks would result in completely blank tests.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67402,"text":"But denatured proteins are sticky beasts.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67403,"text":"All of those perfectly evolved interactions that would normally hold the protein together are now orphaned and looking for something to bind to.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67404,"text":"So a likely explanation is that the immobilised antibodies at the T-line stick directly to the gold particles as they pass by, producing the notorious cola-induced false positive result.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67405,"text":"Is there then a way to spot a fake positive test?","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67406,"text":"The antibodies (like most proteins) are capable of refolding and regaining their function when they are returned to more favourable conditions.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67407,"text":"So I tried washing a test that had been dripped with cola with buffer solution, and sure enough the immobilised antibodies at the T-line regained normal function and released the gold particles, revealing the true negative result on the test.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":68059,"text":"As discussed above, part of the reason for the relatively low total amount that has been reimbursed through this fund is likely due to the program being limited to patients with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68060,"text":"Additionally, it is also unclear how many uninsured COVID-19 patients are being billed for their care because their providers are unaware of this program or have chosen to not participate.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":72734,"text":"One lingering mystery is how the novel coronavirus robs its victims of these senses.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72735,"text":"Early in the pandemic, physicians and researchers worried that COVID-related anosmia might signal that the virus makes its way into the brain through the nose, where it could do severe and lasting damage.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72736,"text":"A suspected route would be via the olfactory neurons that sense odors in the air and transmit these signals to the brain.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72737,"text":"But studies have shown that this is probably not the case, says Sandeep Robert Datta, a neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72738,"text":"“My gestalt read of the data to date suggests that the primary source of insult is actually in the nose, in the nasal epithelium,” the skinlike layer of cells responsible for registering odors.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72739,"text":"“It looks like the virus attacks, predominantly, support cells and stem cells and not neurons directly,” Datta says.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72740,"text":"But that fact does not mean that neurons cannot be affected, he emphasizes.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72741,"text":"Olfactory neurons do not have angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, which allow the virus entry to cells, on their surface.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72742,"text":"But sustentacular cells, which support olfactory neurons in important ways, are studded with the receptors.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72743,"text":"These cells maintain the delicate balance of salt ions in the mucus that neurons depend on to send signals to the brain.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72744,"text":"If that balance is disrupted, it could lead to a shutdown of neuronal signaling—and therefore of smell.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72745,"text":"The sustentacular cells also provide the metabolic and physical support needed to sustain the fingerlike cilia on the olfactory neurons where receptors that detect odors are concentrated.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72746,"text":"“If you physically disrupt those cilia, you lose the ability to smell,” Datta says.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72747,"text":"In a study in Brain, Behavior and Immunity, Nicolas Meunier, a neuroscientist at Paris-Saclay University in France, infected the noses of golden Syrian hamsters with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72748,"text":"Just two days later about half of the hamsters' sustentacular cells were infected.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72749,"text":"But olfactory neurons were not infected even after two weeks.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72750,"text":"And strikingly, the olfactory epithelia were completely detached, which, Meunier says, resembled skin peeling after a sunburn.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72751,"text":"Although olfactory neurons were not infected, their cilia were entirely gone.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72752,"text":"“If you remove the cilia, you remove the olfactory receptors and the ability to detect odorants,” he says.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72753,"text":"Disruption of the olfactory epithelium could explain the loss of smell.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72754,"text":"Yet it remains unclear whether the damage is done by the virus itself or invading immune cells, which Meunier observed after infection.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72755,"text":"Widespread reports of anosmia with COVID are not typical of other diseases caused by viruses.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72756,"text":"“We think it's very specific to SARS-CoV-2,” Meunier says.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72757,"text":"In a previous study with other respiratory viruses at his laboratory, he found sustentacular cells infected only rarely, whereas with SARS-CoV-2, about half of cells contained the pathogen.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72758,"text":"With other viruses, smell is usually compromised by a stuffed-up nose, but COVID does not usually cause nasal congestion.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72759,"text":"“This is very different,” Meunier says.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72760,"text":"Researchers have found a few clues about the loss of smell, but they are less certain about how the virus causes a loss of taste.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72761,"text":"Taste receptor cells, which detect chemicals in the saliva and send signals to the brain, do not contain ACE2, so they probably do not get infected by SARS-CoV-2.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72762,"text":"But other support cells in the tongue carry the receptor, perhaps providing some indication of why taste goes away.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72763,"text":"(Although taste can seem to disappear with anosmia because odors are such a key component of flavor, many people with COVID truly develop ageusia and cannot detect even sweet or salty taste.)","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72764,"text":"The loss of chemical sensing—the burn of hot chilies or the refreshing sensation of mint—also remains unexplained and largely unexplored.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72765,"text":"These sensations are not tastes.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72766,"text":"Instead their detection is conveyed by pain-sensing nerves—some of which contain ACE2—throughout the body, including the mouth.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72767,"text":"More clues to how the virus obliterates smell come from people recovering from anosmia.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72768,"text":"“The majority of patients lose smell like a light switch going off and recover it rapidly,” Datta says.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72769,"text":"“There's a fraction of patients that have much more persistent anosmia and recover on longer time scales.”","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72770,"text":"The olfactory epithelium regularly regenerates.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72771,"text":"“That's the body's way of protecting against the constant onslaught of toxins in the environment,” Meunier says.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72772,"text":"Still, more than seven months after he first experienced anosmia, Kantor falls in the second group of patients: he has yet to detect any odors at all.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
{"id":72773,"text":"“It's hard because you don't realize how much you relate to smell until you lose it,” he says.","labels":[],"Comments":[]}
