Most people with Long Covid face stigma and discrimination
The majority of people living with Long Covid experience some form of stigma directly related to their condition, according to a new study published in the journal PLOS ONE.
An estimated 2.3 million people are living with Long Covid in the UK according to the Office for National Statistics data, and numbers are not decreasing due to limited treatment options and continued high Covid infection rates.
Testimonies illustrate profound stigmas experienced by people living with Long Covid, but until now there has been no quantitative assessment of the burden.
In the study, conducted by researchers at the University of Southampton and Brighton and Sussex Medical School and co-designed by people living with Long Covid (from the charity Long Covid Support), people who took part in the 2020 Long Covid online survey were invited to complete a follow up survey in November 2021.
More than 1100 people took part, including 966 people from the UK, and were asked about their experiences of stigma in three areas: Enacted stigma where individuals were directly treated unfairly due to their health condition; internalised stigma where people felt embarrassed or ashamed of their health condition, and anticipated stigma, which is the individual’s expectation they will be treated poorly because of their condition.
Ninety-five percent of people experienced at least one type of stigma at least ‘sometimes’, and 76 percent experiencing it ‘often’ or ‘always’, according to the results.
Dr Marija Pantelic, Lecturer in Public Health at Brighton and Sussex Medical School, who led the development of the stigma questions in the follow up survey, said: “There have been countless anecdotal reports of the stigma, dismissal and discrimination faced by people living with Long Covid.
This study was the first to empirically measure this stigma and estimate prevalence.
We were shocked to see just how prevalent it is, but the findings also empower us to do something about it.
With the stigma questionnaire we developed, we can measure changes over time and the effectiveness of urgently needed anti-stigma interventions.”
In the study, nearly two thirds (63 percent) of people reported experiences of stigma such as being treated with less respect or people they care about stopping contact with them due to their health condition, while 91 percent expected to experience stigma and discrimination, for example they thought many people did not consider Long Covid to be a real illness or they anticipated judgment.
Eighty-six percent of respondents felt a profound sense of shame related to having Long Covid - they were embarrassed of their illness and felt ‘very different’ from people without Long Covid.
In the study, 61 percent of people said they were very careful who they tell about their condition, and about one third (34 percent) of respondents regretted having told people about it.
Overall, the prevalence of experiencing stigma was higher in those who reported having a clinical diagnosis of Long Covid compared to those without or who were unsure (83 percent v 69 percent).
Nisreen Alwan, Professor of Public Health at the University of Southampton and co-lead author of the study, added: “We were surprised to find that people with a clinical diagnosis of Long Covid were more likely to report stigma than people without a formal diagnosis.
We are not sure why this is - perhaps because they are more likely to share their health status with others or perhaps because they have engaged more with health services.
More research is needed to unpack the potential mechanisms of how and where this stigma is manifested, and who is most likely to stigmatise and be stigmatised.”
Claire Hastie from the charity Long Covid Support who also worked on the study, said: “Sadly we see the results of stigma all too often among members of our support group.
In addition to the significant health burden of Long Covid, the stigma and discrimination associated with the condition can lead to relationship breakdowns and problems at work.
These cause immense additional distress, which itself can compromise healing.
It is vital that people with the condition are believed and supported to help their chances of recovery.”
“The stigma attached to Long Covid is harming people living with Long Covid and is likely to leave a devastating mark on our society and health service provision,’ Dr Pantelic added.
“We know from decades of research with other long-term conditions such as asthma, depression, and HIV that stigma has dire consequences for public health.
Fear of stigma is also likely to drive people away from health services and other support, which over time has detrimental consequences on people’s physical and mental health.”
UC Riverside’s employee COVID-19 testing center has moved to a new location and is now available to all faculty and staff members and their families.
Formerly at HUB 302, the testing center moved Monday, Nov. 15 to the Bear Cave meeting room at Pentland Hills.
It is open Monday and Thursday from 8-11 a.m. and 12-4 p.m. On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday the hours are 6:30-11 a.m. and 12-2:30 p.m.
The campus opened the center to provide employees and their family, including children, free and convenient access to testing.
The University of California is requiring all students, staff, and faculty members to provide proof of vaccination or request an exception.
Those not fully vaccinated and have approved exceptions are required to be tested weekly.
Testing is also required for those with a confirmed exposure and for employees experiencing COVID-19 symptoms.
The site was initially only available to employees who were required to be tested and given instructions on how to schedule the appointment.
The center is now open to all employees and their families regardless of vaccination status.
Visit the UCR COVID-19 Testing Center Scheduler to find out how to schedule an appointment.
All participants must register with Color, the health technology company UCR and the California Department of Public Health are partnering with to report required demographic information and provide test results.
The test kits use a nasal swab that individuals getting tested must rub inside each nostril for 15 seconds.
A trained staff member is on hand to observe and ensure that the test is conducted correctly.
Results will be sent directly to employees via email or text.
Employees may also check their results at Color’s website.
Employees who receive a positive test notification are required to immediately report the results through the Daily Wellness Check.
UCR has a separate testing program for students in place since last fall, also at the Bear Cave.
The room has two entrances with a wall divider installed in the middle so that students and employees are tested on different sides.
Ling
Before a community hospital is stretched thin with COVID-19-patients, even before antigen tests — no matter how rapid — return results, there is one place that may be able to capture the number of COVID-19 infections in a community.
A new research paper from the lab of Fangqiong Ling, assistant professor of energy, environmental and chemical engineering at Washington University in St. Louis’ McKelvey School of Engineering, has shown the viability of wastewater as an accurate tool when it comes to describing COVID-19 outbreaks in a community.
Beyond proving the usefulness of COVID-19 detection, the breadth of the paper’s analysis also makes it a resource for other researchers in the fast-growing field of wastewater epidemiology.
The research was published as the cover story of the July 22 issue of the journal Environmental Science, Water Research & Technology.

Why wastewater?
“Our premise is that wastewater can serve as an unbiased way to collect information,” Mantilla-Calderon said.
It has the potential to be a more representative sample of infection than, for instance, cases reported by a hospital for several reasons, including: Asymptomatic people don’t get tested as often.
Some people don’t have easy access to tests.
Many people with mild symptoms use home tests, and those results aren’t shared with hospitals.
Not everyone sheds the virus through feces — studies suggest about 40% to 65% of people do.
But of that group, about 50% are asymptomatic and likely would not have been tested.
“The public wastewater infrastructure is perhaps the piece of social infrastructure that’s most equitable toward people,” Ling said.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers across the world have begun or ramped up existing water monitoring programs.
Working collaboratively with the Washington University School of Medicine and researchers from two other universities, Ling and David Mantilla-Calderon, a postdoctoral associate in her lab, took advantage of the data to determine what, if any, relationship they could find between the number of COVID-19 cases reported in an area and the amount of genetic material from SARS-CoV-2 in municipal wastewater.
Starting with 101 studies of wastewater from around the globe, Ling and her team decided on a set of common variables and other inclusion criteria that had to be met to accurately combine data for a kind of “study of studies” known as a meta-analysis systematic review.
This kind of study allows researchers to investigate a question using much more data than they could have collected themselves; ultimately, they were able to use 20 of the 101 studies.
“In general, we found a positive correlation,” Mantilla-Calderon said.
As recorded cases went up, they found more viral material in the wastewater.
“But it’s not a one-to-one correlation — the strength of the correlation changes with each system.”
That’s because every wastewater system is unique.
Mantilla-Calderon knows this better than most because he has a background in wastewater monitoring and is familiar with the ways these systems can vary.
Wastewater systems can be built from different materials and use different processes or chemicals at different parts of the system.
They often are built in different configurations and serve vastly different-sized populations.
Adding to the study’s complexity, among the 20 papers that shared enough variables to be included in the study, different researchers used different RNA extraction methods.
It’s these quirks of individual wastewater systems and of researchers’ methods and preferences that have led to a field full of data without enough context to make it generalizable.
With this paper, however, Ling’s lab has made a significant contribution toward defining that context.
“The study provides general statistical guidance,” Mantilla-Calderon said.
In the future, researchers will be able to use it to help them better understand how to interpret their data, given the kinds of samples they have and the systems they are working with.
It also begins to bridge any gaps between medical researchers and engineers.
“We use the same kind of meta-analysis systematic review method that’s typically used in clinical research,” Ling said.
“This creates a kind of common language for medical researchers and engineering researchers.”
This may facilitate the exchange of data and results, leading to a more robust understanding of the relationships between viruses moving through the engineered world and diseases spreading through populations.

Study characteristics
The initial search of the databases identified a total of 1347 potentially relevant records.
After excluding duplicates, 1114 articles remained, and titles and abstracts of the remaining records were scanned as part of a new screening according to inclusion and exclusion criteria previously established.
Four gray literatures were also analyzed.
A total of 1077 articles were excluded based on the exclusion criteria.
The remaining 37 articles that met the inclusion criteria were thoroughly examined.
Among these, eight were excluded, and the remaining 29 were included for the review.

Among the clinical studies, 17 of them reportedly applied cell therapy to treat COVID-19, while the remaining eight studies investigated cell therapy as a treatment for ARDS.
Additionally, four clinical COVID-19 articles were included as gray literature, bringing the total of selected clinical studies to 29.
None of the included articles applied cell therapy to MERS or SARS-CoV-1.
The clinical and study characteristics are described in Table 1.
Table 1 Clinical and study characteristics.

Study designs and evidence levels
Among the 29 included clinical studies
, there were eight case reports (27.5%), five Phase I clinical trials (17.2%), four (13.7%) pilot studies, two Phase II clinical trials (6.8%), one cohort (3.4%), and one case series (3.4%).
The study designs and classification of evidence are described in Table 2.
Table 2 Study designs and evidence levels.
Full size table
It should be noted that eight (27.5%) studies used cell therapy as compassionate use and one (3.4%) as a proof of concept.
Most studies (75%) used mesenchymal stem cell therapy in an attempt to treat COVID-19.
The articles were categorized based on levels of scientific evidence following the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine Classification9 and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE)10.
According to the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine Classification9, of the 29 included articles, five were classified as grade A recommendations; within these, two (6.8%) were 1 A, and three (10.3%) were 1B. Among grade B recommendations, there were 14 studies.
The levels of evidence were eight (27.5%) 2B and six (20.6%) 2 C. Among grade C recommendations, ten (34.4%) articles were classified as level 4 evidence.
According to the GRADE10, of the 29 included articles, two (6.8%) were considered high evidence level, three (10.3%) moderate, fourteen (48.2%) low, and ten (38.4%) minimal evidence level.
Patient characteristics
Clinical studies using cell therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 patients were performed in five different countries.
Following are the total numbers of patients by country from all 29 studies: China (n = 238), the United States (n = 30), Spain (n = 13), Iran (n = 11), and Germany (n = 23).
Clinical studies that investigated ARDS included patients from the United States (n = 96), the United Kingdom (n = 30), China (n = 20), Sweden (n = 5), Mexico (n = 5), and South Korea (n = 1).
Age of the patients ranged from 19 to 86 years.
Intervention characteristics
Among the 29 selected clinical articles, eleven types of umbilical cord MSCs were analyzed.
The cell types investigated in the studies comprised (1) human umbilical cord MSCs11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21, (2) cardiosphere-derived MSCs22, (3) human bone marrow MSCs (hBM-MSCs)23,24,25,26,27,28, (4) extracellular vesicles derived from BM-MSCs29, (5) autologous peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cells (PBMCs)30, (6) human adipose tissue-derived MSCs31,32, (7) allogeneic bone marrow-derived multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPC) expanded ex vivo33, (8) ACE2-MSCs34, (9) human menstrual blood-derived MSCs35,36, (10) immunity‐and matrix-regulatory cells (IMRCs)37, and (11) MSCs derived from perinatal tissues38.
Main parameters
A total of five groups of readouts—all of them subdivided into several parameters—were identified among the clinical studies.
Laboratory measurements were common to 25 out of the 29 clinical articles, representing 86.2% of our study sample.
The cited parameters included standard laboratory measurements, such as lymphocyte count, COVID-19 PCR test, basic metabolic panel (BMP) and levels of procalcitonin, ferritin, angiopoietin, d-dimer, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine, CKMB, cardiac troponin, and immune system parameters, such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-1ɑ, IL-1β, TNF-ɑ, and IL-1.
Twenty studies, which correspond to 68.9% of the included studies, investigated pulmonary function using various parameters and exams, such as chest X-ray, bronchoscopy, chest CT, lung compliance, lung injury score (LIS), and the following biomarkers: receptor for advanced glycation end-product (AGER), which is a marker for lung epithelial injury, and angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2), a marker for endothelial injury.
All studies evaluated adverse reactions, safety, and mortality after the intervention.
Ten studies (34.4%) analyzed the relationship between cell therapy and the discontinuation of ventilator support.
Furthermore, eight studies (27.5%) documented additional data, such as mental status, patient’s physical capacity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) assessment, e electrocardiogram (EKG), viral load, blood type and screen, blood culture, urine culture, and body mass index (BMI).
Main outcomes
Among the 14 studies that evaluated lymphocyte counts before and after cell therapy, 12 reported a statistically significant elevation in lymphocyte numbers (85.7%).
Fourteen of the seventeen studies which assessed CRP levels reported a decrease in this parameter (82.3%).
As for plasma cytokines, cell therapy was found to reduce IL-6 levels in nine (52.9%) out of seventeen studies that investigated this parameter.
TNF-α levels decreased in five out of seven studies (71.4%) that assessed its posttreatment values.
Five out of six studies that measured ferritin reported a significant reduction after cell infusion, while six out of eight studies (75%) reported a D-dimer decrease.
Remarkably, all studies that evaluated the following pulmonary parameters reported a statistically significant difference between pre- and post-cell therapy results: there was an increase in PaO2/FIO2 ratio in 12 out of 14 articles (85.7%), an increase in oxygen saturation in 50% of the articles and an improvement on lung image—chest CT or chest radiography—in 15 out of 17 studies (88.2%).
Eighteen studies assessed symptoms at admission and clinical status after cell therapy, and all of them reported clinical improvement.
Additionally, 11 out of 14 studies (78.5%) demonstrated discontinuation of oxygen support (intubation and ECMO) after cell infusion at a statistically significant rate.
Nine studies reported a reduction in mortality, but two of them did not report a significant reduction (77.7%).
Six studies evaluated and reported improvement in the duration of hospitalization.
The primary outcomes and evaluated parameters are summarized in Table 3.

Evidence level:
1A and 1B studies
Studies in higher evidence level categories (1A and 1B) described some noteworthy findings.
In a randomized phase 2 safety trial for patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS, Matthay et al. revealed a decrease in endothelial injury ascertained by reduced plasma concentrations of ANGPT2 in the MSC-treated patients versus the control group27.
They also reported that after MSC therapy, there was a trend towards a decreased number of ventilator-free and organ failure-free days and improved oxygenation index, although not significantly27.
Notably, the number of intensive care-free days was found to be statistically relevant.
Additionally, they showed a reduction in the levels of CRP and ANGPT2 biomarkers27.
Shi and colleagues performed a multicenter, randomized placebo-controlled phase 2 efficacy trial with 100 severe COVID-19 patients, who either received placebo (n = 35) or umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC) infusion (n = 65) alongside the common care treatments.
Supplementary oxygen was necessary for 44 (67.69%) patients from the treatment group and for 23 (65.71%)
patients from the placebo group.
They noticed that UC-MSC infusions could reduce the proportion of abnormal lung lesions, especially lesions with solid appearance, compared to placebo.
In this study, MSCs led to a decrease in ground-glass lesions; however, it was not significant compared to the placebo group19.
Both articles classified 1 A according to Oxford and GRADE systems described that cell therapy was a safe and well-tolerated alternative19,27.
All three papers classified as 1B also concluded that the procedure was safe14,31,33.
Zheng et al.
in a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 12 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS were arbitrarily assigned to receive either allogeneic adipose-derived humans MSCs or placebo.
They observed that the MSC group displayed a significant improvement in oxygenation index, compared to baseline values—but not compared to placebo.
Parameters such as ventilator-free and ICU-free days and serum IL-6 and IL-8 levels did not show a difference when the baseline values were compared to predetermined time points31.
Bellingan et al. reported that MSCs reduced mortality and increased ventilator-free and ICU-free days compared to placebo33.
Lanzoni et al. conducted a controlled, double-blinded, randomized phase 1/2a clinical trial to determine the safety and efficacy of UC-MSC infusion in 24 patients with COVID-19 ARDS.
The subjects were divided into a UC-MSC infusion (n = 12) and a placebo (n = 12) group.
They noticed that UC-MSC infusion significantly contributed to improved patient survival and time of recovery.
This study also reported a significant decrease in the following inflammatory cytokines after treatment: GM‐CSF (pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage phenotype inducer), IFN-γ, IL‐5, IL‐6, IL‐7, TNF-α, TNF- β, and others14.
Evidence level 2B and 2C studies
Wilson and associates conducted a study to assess the safety and the maximally tolerated dose of MSCs - up to 10 million cells/kg predicted body weight (PBW).
The study was a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, noncontrolled phase 1 clinical trial, in which nine patients were equally subdivided into three intervention groups: low dose MSCs (1 million cells/kg PBW), an intermediate dose MSCs (5 million cells/kg PBW), and the high dose MSCs (10 million cells/kg PBW).
After the treatment, the concentrations of several biomarkers (IL-6, IL-8, AGER, and ANGPT2) were decreased when compared between the baseline and day 3 values31,33.
However, it is not possible to relate these findings to the previously reported changes in biomarkers, due to the lack of a matched control group with the MSCs treatment group in this study.
Hashemian and collaborators performed a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, noncontrolled trial, with 11 subjects that either received freeze/thawed UC-MSCs (n = 6) or fresh PL-MSCs (n = 11).
They noted that inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α) were significantly decreased after the MSC infusions.
Notably, the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 levels were also increased in four cases.
Moreover, the study reported that nine (81.81%) treated patients tolerated the MSCs infusions38.
In a pilot study, Leng et al investigated the early efficacy of MSC therapy in seven patients with COVID-19 pneumonia along with the placebo treatment in three patients.
Two days after infusions, they found improvements in pulmonary function, decreased levels of CRP and inflammatory cytokines, and augmented IL-10 concentration and regulatory DC cells34.
Meng F. et al. conducted a controlled, non-randomized, phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety of human umbilical cord-derived MSC infusions in 18 patients.
They observed that four patients displaying the highest levels of IL-6 showed a substantial decrease within 3 days of the treatment, but no such trend was observed in patients with low plasma IL-6.
Regarding the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, there were improvements in most of the severe patients.
Additionally, there was a decline in concentrations of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IFN-γ, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), interferon-inducible cytokine IP-10 (IP-10), IL-22, interleukin 1 receptor type 1 (IL-1RA), IL18, IL-8, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha (MIP-1)17.
In a concept study, 13 severe COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation and receiving the standard care treatment were infused with adipose tissue-derived MSCs.
Within 5 days of the treatment nine (70%) patients showed clinical improvements with significant reductions in CRP, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and ferritin.
Moreover, five patients demonstrated improvements concerning B-lymphocyte alongside better CD4+ and CD8+ counts, and ultimately, after the MSCs infusion seven patients were extubated within a median time of 7 days32.
Shu, L. et al. conducted a single-center open-label, randomized trial involving 41 patients.
Compared to the control group (n = 29), CRP and IL-6 levels were significantly decreased from day 3 after UC-MSC infusions (n = 12)18.
In this study, the small sample size and the treatment change during the trial were the major limitations18.
Tang and colleagues tested the effects of infusions of menstrual blood-derived MSCs in two severe COVID-19 patients.
They reported increased lymphocytes, decreased inflammation indicators (i.e., lower CRP and IL-6 levels) after MSC infusions, and antiviral treatment36.
Another pilot study conducted by Feng et al. investigated the efficacy of UC-MSCs in 16 patients; among them, seven were categorized as critically severe and nine as severe.
They reported improvements in oxygenation index, CRP, and procalcitonin levels in severe and critically severe groups.
In addition, the study noted augmented levels of CD4 + cells, CD8 + T cells, and NK cell counts within 28 days of the infusion21.
In a clinical trial involving MSC infusions in 31 patients, the PaO2/FiO2 level and lymphocyte counts showed a substantial increase, whereas the CRP, PCT, IL-6, and D-dimer were significantly decreased compared to the baseline values before infusions11.
In a single-center, open-label, non-randomized, noncontrolled conducted by Singh et al.
in the earliest days of the COVID-19 outbreak, six patients received allogeneic cardiosphere-derived cells after receiving an anti-IL-6 agent.
The levels of Ferritin, CRP, and IL-6 were decreased after the cardiosphere-derived cell infusion22.
However, the decrease cannot be attributed only to cell therapy due to the prior treatment with anti-1L-6 agent22.
In a non-randomized open-label trial, Sengupta et al. apprised the safety and efficacy of an allogeneic bone marrow MSC-secreted extracellular vesicles (ExoFloTM) in 24 severe COVID-19 patients.
Three days after infusions, they noted improvements in PaO2/FiO2 ratio (p < 0.001), significant increases in the absolute counts of neutrophils, CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ lymphocytes, and decline in CRP, ferritin, and D-dimer levels after 5 days of ExoFloTM treatment29.
The major limitations of this study were the lack of randomization and blinding.
Chen et al. performing a single-center, open-label, non-randomized, noncontrolled trial comprising 25 patients, reported improved CT parameters in 16 patients after MSC infusions (64%).
However, there were no changes in inflammation indices, including CRP, WBC, PCT, and IL-6 levels.
Moreover, there were no changes in IgG or IgM.
In contrast, the serum levels of lactate, cardiac troponin T, and creatine Kinase were elevated after the treatment23.
Low statistical power due to the small sample size was a significant limitation in this study.
Häberle and associates, in a single-center, open-label, non-randomized, noncontrolled trial, enrolled 23 patients to either placebo (n = 18) or MSC treatment (n = 5).
No differences in CRP and IL-6 were found between the groups.
Notably, ferritin level was increased in the MSC-treated group after discharge.
Notwithstanding, there was a significant reduction in neutrophils, lymphocytes, and leukocytes at discharge in the MSC treatment group compared to the placebo group28.
Evidence level 4C studies
Most studies with 4 C evidence levels were case reports, and hence the results could not be compared to findings seen in trials comprising larger cohorts of patients.
It is also noteworthy that one cannot establish a cause–effect relationship from findings in case reports.
Adverse effects
All clinical studies analyzed the occurrence of adverse effects (AE) related to cell therapy.
Studies whose primary endpoint was safety mainly defined the occurrence of prespecified infusion-associated AEs within 6 h of infusions in addition to cardiac arrest or death within 24 h of infusions.
A total of 16 studies (55.1%) reported the occurrence of side effects, with only a minority of the studies (24.1%) attributing the side effects directly to the use of cell therapy.
Approximately 41% of the studies reported that the observed side effects were not linked to the MSC treatment.
Twenty-seven (93.1%) studies did not report the AEs during the administration of MSCs.
The AE are also detailed in Table 4.
Table 4 Adverse effects.
Full size table
AE related to cell infusion
As for the side effects observed at the time of infusions or within hours after infusions, one study reported hypoxemia, hypotension and/or hypertension, and muscle spasms, but they were easily controlled and did not acutely alter the patients’ medical conditions16.
A clinical trial observed transient facial flushing and fever immediately after the infusion, which resolved spontaneously17.
One clinical trial detected diarrhea and a rash in the chest area, but it resolved31.
Another article reported a single Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade-1 infusion-related reaction, which settled without intervention33.
One patient experienced transient shivering, which occurred once in two cases and disappeared in less than 1 h38.
AE related to cell therapy
A study reported worsening of bradycardia in a subject who previously had bradycardia and required transient vasopressor treatment14.
One pilot study observed liver dysfunction, heart failure, and allergic rash after treatment, but fortunately, all patients survived—the report did not specify the possible reason for the occurrence of these adverse reactions.
Nevertheless, the serum levels of lactate, serum cardiac troponin, and creatine kinase were significantly increased after MSCs therapy, reinforcing the cautious use of MSC infusions in patients with previous metabolic acidosis and coronary heart disease14.
AE not related to cell therapy
Adverse events unrelated to cell therapy included progressively increased creatinine, epistaxis, and hematuria; a patient was also diagnosed with lower-extremity arterial thrombosis16.
Another patient experienced hypoxemia, which was thought to be caused by the progression of COVID-19 based on previously existing symptoms17.
One patient experienced pneumothorax, which recovered spontaneously under conservative treatment, and it was judged by the site investigators and found to be unrelated to MSCs intervention19.
Feng et al. reported two patients with bacterial pneumonia and septic shock as complications of severe COVID-1921.
In a case series, one patient developed nosocomial pneumonia with fever several days after MSC infusions, but it was not related to cell therapy as per the report.
Nonetheless, it remains to be addressed whether MSC infusions increase the risk of infectious complications in COVID-19 patients with ARDS, although no such increases were seen earlier in MSC clinical trials involving immune-competent recipients25.
Wilson et al. reported multiple embolic infarcts, which were thought to be present before MSC infusions based on a previous MRI scan26.
Another trial observed a worsening hypoxic state, a respiratory failure requiring intubation, pulmonary embolism, and acute renal failure.
The reactions were reviewed by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), which concluded that the symptoms were unrelated to the therapeutic intervention29.
One subject experienced pneumonia due to a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and another patient developed a fungal infection by Candida spp32.
Mortality
There were no reported deaths directly linked to stem cell administration.
Death was observed in 17 studies, and a total of 79 patients died out of 472, including placebo and patients who received MSCs.
It was reported that 47 (14%) deaths occurred among 330 patients receiving MSC infusions, while the placebo groups had 32 (23%) deaths out of 142 patients.
Five studies described deaths caused by complications of COVID-1911,16,18,21,29.
One patient experienced repeated infections by multidrug-resistant pathogens and eventually suffered septic shock and died13.
A phase II trial reported two deaths in the MSC-treated group, secondary to acute respiratory failure; both were reviewed and declared as unrelated to MSC infusions14.
Iglesias et al. reported two deaths; the first patient developed acute renal failure and the second cardiomyopathy and liver failure16.
A pilot trial observed two deaths caused by pneumonia and septic shock, which were lethal complications of COVID-19 and occurred independently of MSC treatment21.
A phase I trial noted one death in the MSC treatment group and two deaths in the placebo group, but none of the deaths were considered to be related to MSC infusions by the clinical investigators and were consistent with the patients existing disease processes26.
One patient had a fatal cardiopulmonary arrest; however, it was attributed to a preexisting history of coronary artery disease, and the DSMB judged that the death was likely not related to MSC infusions27.
In another clinical trial, one patient in the MSC infusions group died of multiple organ failure, which was concluded as not related to MSC infusions by the clinical investigators and was consistent with the patient’s disease progression31.
Jungebluth et al. reported multisystem organ failure after MSC infusions, possibly secondary to disseminated fungal infection and intra-abdominal sepsis30.
Among the two patients who died, one was due to gastrointestinal bleeding and another to secondary pneumonia, unassociated with MSC therapy32.
Another trial reported five deaths after cell infusions, two were intubated, two had signs of sepsis, the fifth patient had a cardiac arrest, and none of the deaths were considered connected to cell therapy38.
The mortality after MSC infusions is described in Table 5.
ANCHORAGE — There was one bed coming available in the intensive care unit in Alaska’s largest hospital.
It was the middle of the night, and the hospital, Providence Alaska Medical Center in Anchorage, had been hit with a deluge of coronavirus patients.
Doctors now had a choice to make: Several more patients at the hospital, most of them with Covid-19, were in line to take that last I.C.U. spot.
But there was also someone from one of the state’s isolated rural communities who needed to be flown in for emergency surgery.
Who should get the final bed?
Dr. ​​Steven Floerchinger gathered with his colleagues for an agonizing discussion.
They had a better chance of saving one of the patients in the emergency room, they determined.
The other person would have to wait.
That patient died.
“This is gut-wrenching, and I never thought I’d see it,” said Dr. ​​Floerchinger, who has been in practice for 30 years.
“We are taxed to a point of making decisions of who will and who will not live.”
What do the latest models look like for COVID?
This time, we were trying to look at some of the new variants that are emerging.
We’ve stopped designating them as Greek letters, and now one of the leading ways to designate them is by levels based on the numbers of mutations.
We were looking at what’s called level 5, 6, and 7 variants.
Level 5 captures some of the variants people are hearing about like BQ.1, whereas levels 6 and 7 capture variants like BQ1.1, XBB, and some deviants of those.
These are characterized by their ability to escape immunity in the population.
What’s protecting us right now is that we’ve developed so much immunity.
But new variants are continuing to emerge, so we’re trying to understand what impact these potential immune-escaping characteristics might have coming into the winter season, when we’ve got flu and RSV happening at the same time.
Looking at those variants, along with the impact of boosters—specifically, the new bivalent booster—we are projecting that we will see a fairly large increase in the number of hospitalizations this winter.
We’re already starting to see numbers go up quite a bit.
We’re not quite out of the woods with this thing.
What are the key factors that you’re looking at to determine whether this could be a bad winter from a COVID perspective?
I think it’s really being driven by these variants.
We have a pretty good sense of the vaccine.
A couple of new reports have come out, including one from MMWR, showing that the new booster has some advantage compared to the previous monovalent boosters.
And of course, just getting a booster in general re-ups your immunity, which we know wanes pretty quickly at this point.
But really, it’s these new variants.
We’re constantly monitoring them to see which ones are taking over as the dominant strains.
So as the models project variants with more immune escape, you’re predicting more hospitalizations into March and April.
A lot of factors are contributing to what that timeline looks like.
I think the March–April timeline is probably less likely.
It really depends on how much infection occurs this winter.
If a lot of people get infected in the next month or two, we’re going to be less likely to see something in the spring, and currently we are seeing quite a bit of rise.
There are certain states where it’s even more pronounced—California is seeing a really rapid rise right now.
They are currently at the number of hospitalizations they saw this summer when the BA.4 and BA.5 variants were taking over, and they are still rising.
That might be a picture of what’s to come in other states as well.
What about the flu situation?
We are projecting a pretty substantial flu season.
Right now, hospitalizations are tracking pretty well with our most pessimistic scenario, which is defined by the fact that there is very little immunity in the population because we haven’t been infected in the last couple of years.
Our projections are a much earlier season, which we already know is happening, and a much larger season than we’re used to seeing.
In our previous worst season, we experienced somewhere around 37,000 hospitalizations in the peak week.
We’re expecting it to be substantially larger—up to about 46,000 to 50,000, with the potential for even larger numbers.
I remember when the flu alone could tip over the health care system.
And the combination of the COVID and flu is daunting.
We ran the numbers and combined them from our projection rounds, and we’re seeing potentials of 60,000–70,000 hospitalizations in the peak week toward the end of December.
What about RSV?
The good news with RSV is that it looks like it’s trending down already.
It seems to have had its season a bit earlier than the other two viruses, so hopefully there won’t be a synchronization of peaks, which is the scary thing that I think is starting to happen with COVID and flu.
But, different populations are affected.
COVID is not affecting the pediatric population nearly to the extent that RSV or flu is, and RSV doesn’t generally send many adults to the hospital, so that’s good news.
But we’re still seeing pediatric hospitals overwhelmed right now, so I think we’re going to have a lot of tired health care workers and parents as well.
It sounds like there’s every reason to get the new booster and a flu shot if you haven’t yet.
Absolutely.
They’re our best protection.
And the reports on flu vaccine effectiveness are really good—this is one of the best flu vaccines we’ve seen in years.
As I said earlier, the bivalent COVID-19 booster shows good improvement over the previous booster.
We know that getting a booster re-ups your antibodies and your immunity.
Even if it doesn’t prevent you from getting infected, it’s going to keep you from having a serious illness, or even an annoying one where you’re out of work, tired, and not feeling well.

During the period between the first and second surveys (February 2021 to December 2021), in terms of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs, the infectivity rate increased from 1.78 to 3.06%.
During this period, the number of COVID-19 cases increased approximately five-fold, from 2467 to 12,477 in Shiga Prefecture4.
The cumulative case number until December 28, 2021, was 12,477, which corresponded to 0.9% of the 1.41 million population in Shiga Prefecture, and the number of seropositive persons was presumably estimated as three to six times of that number.
Thus, the antibody-positive rate in the general population should be 2.7–5.4%, which could not be factually assessed in this study.
The infectious seropositivity rate (3.06%) among HCWs was also within this range and was not considered particularly high.
Thus, this confirms that HCWs are at low risk of COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections16.
In Shiga Prefecture, the risk of occupational infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 for HCWs was not higher than that for the general population; therefore, we conclude that HCWs should not be recognized by the local communities as having an increased risk for COVID-19.
Although 29 unvaccinated HCWs were included in this survey, none of them tested seropositive for infectious antibodies, and the vaccination rate among the HCWs was extremely high at 98.2%, suggesting that the unvaccinated HCWs were protected from SARS-CoV-2 infection due to a high level of herd immunity.
HCWs are considered well-protected from SARS-CoV-2 infection with a higher vaccine coverage than that in the general population and intensive use of protective materials at work16.
Among the 31 HCWs newly identified as infectious seropositive, 23 were considered asymptomatic and unaware of being infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Including the 18 infected participants during the first survey, there were 49 infectious seropositive participants in this study; no participant with severe disease required hospitalization or experienced post-acute sequelae of COVID-19.
Referring to the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in Japan on April 18, 2022 (7,386,815; 473,672 requiring hospitalization and 29,041 deaths)17, it should be considered that one to four of the 49 infectious seropositive HCWs had severe disease requiring hospitalization, even if it depended on the SARS-CoV-2 strain, age of the patient, and presence of comorbidities.
Based on the reduced number of SARS-CoV-2-infected HCWs in Shiga Prefecture, we believe that the vaccination rollout program for HCWs implemented between March 2021 and April 2021 was effective in protecting HCWs from symptomatic or especially severe illness, at least until the time of conducting the second survey, which was just before the ongoing Omicron strain-predominant waves.
Meanwhile, it has been observed that vaccinated HCWs infected with SARS-CoV-2 usually present with minimal common cold symptoms.
It is considerably difficult to detect such mild cases, and it may be inevitable that breakthrough clusters with SARS-CoV-2 infection occur in medical facilities via transmission of the virus from such patients, including infected medical personnel or the general public.
Furthermore, HCWs may be at a greater risk of contracting COVID-19 from their colleagues or patients with undiagnosed early-stage COVID-19 than that arising from working in the infectious disease unit18.
In the near future, it is desirable to implement control measures focusing on the prevention and treatment of severe cases, rather than those based on the number of COVID-19 cases, and in some cases, also to let infectious disease laws adapt to the social situations and different variants or strains.
In this survey cohort, Spike-IgG values decreased with a half-life of 50–60 days based on the period from the last vaccination (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1), confirming the waning dynamics of humoral immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine over six months19,20,21,22.
Smoking history was associated with infectious seropositivity, and the decrease in Spike-IgG value induced by the vaccination was persistently lower in the smoking group than that in the non-smoking group (Supplementary Fig. 2), which might have been associated with the smoking group’s susceptibility to the infection.
We have also noted some limitations to this study.
This investigation included the predominant periods of the original Wuhan-1, Alpha, and Delta variants but not that caused by the Omicron variant; therefore, the results might not reflect the relevant characteristics of all SARS-CoV-2 strains.
The sample size of this study might not be sufficient to evaluate the statistical correlations between multiple variables, and the design of this survey might not be sufficient to obtain conclusive causal evidence.
Nevertheless, smoking habits and respiratory diseases are possible risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
It was suggested that cellular immunity to endemic coronaviruses might cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 and contribute to protection against hospitalization or death of COVID-195,23.
Cellular immunity induced after COVID-19 vaccination may remain stronger than humoral immunity5.
This study were directly unable to measure neutralizing antibody titers or memory B cell numbers specific to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, but were able to measure the level of binding antibody, which correlates with the neutralizing antibody titers24.
In fact, on our comparative evaluation of cellular and humoral immunities, humoral immunity had risen once but quickly decayed, while T-SPOT value, i.e., T-cell immune response, for SARS-CoV-2 peptides correlated strongly with that for endemic coronavirus and were more robust, although there were individual differences.
HCWs who retained cellular immunity to endemic coronaviruses could effectively induced that to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by COVID-19 vaccination, and could likely maintain robust immunity.
During several months after the second or third dose of the vaccine, the binding antibody levels and neutralizing antibody titers are well proportional, and the former becoming a surrogate for the latter24,25.
However, with prevalent strain like the Omicron variant, higher binding antibody levels are required to protect against the infection24,26.
On the other hand, the cellular immunity induced by the current vaccines has been maintained even against the Omicron variant, and this is a likely contributing factor to not causing serious illness27,28,29.
On analyzing humoral and cellular immunities before and after the third dose of the vaccine, we observed that repeated vaccinations using the present version of the vaccine for introducing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could only induce repeated activation and attenuation of humoral immunity, but could not strengthen cellular immunity or T cell memory in all HCWs, due to the large differences in the immune responses existing among HCWs (Fig. 4).
Even for B cell memory, two doses of the vaccine can induce sufficient responses to various strains of SARS-CoV-2, and repeated vaccinations may not result in further reinforcement of long-term immunity7,30.
In the present study, 3 HCWs with breakthrough infection after their third dose of the vaccine, who had highly Spike-IgG values (> 10,000 AU/mL; Fig. 4) that would have been sufficient to protect against infection with the original Wuhan-1, Alpha or Delta strain, could not prevent the Omicron strain infection, but presented only with minimal common cold symptoms, and did not cause serious illness required hospitalization.
As suggested in previous papers5,27,28,29,31, cellular immunity elicited by two or three doses of the current COVID-19 vaccines has been maintained and cross-reacted also with the Omicron strain, so it seems that this strain infection did not cause severe diseases in these 3 breakthrough cases.
Meanwhile, these 3 breakthrough cases did not have evidence of an additional induction of T cell memory by a fourth repeated exposure to SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins; whereas, the breakthrough infection induced an immune response to the nucleocapsid protein.
Thus, these results do not provide evidence that administering additional doses of the current COVID-19 vaccines would provide sufficient immune protection to the entire population, including HCWs, and vaccination alone will not be sufficient to end the COVID-19 pandemic.
We suggest that other measures should be considered to complement the currently repeated vaccinations, such as introducing vaccines more adapted to the Omicron and future variants, which can be administered after three doses of BNT162b27, or specific therapeutic agents against COVID-19 that can be freely prescribed by health care providers and covered by insurance.
In conclusion, this serological survey specific to SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs in Shiga Prefecture indicated that the seroprevalence among HCWs was not higher than that in the general population.
This result suggests that healthcare facilities and workers are not at high risk for COVID-19 and should not be discriminated from local communities.
The vaccination program was effective in protecting HCWs from serious illness during the original Wuhan-1, Alpha, Delta and also ongoing Omicron-predominance periods.
However, COVID-19 breakthrough clusters may inevitably occur in various medical institutions in the near future.
It is desirable to implement infection control measures placing more emphasis on the prevention and treatment of severe disease rather than on the number of infected patients.
Repeated vaccinations using the current versions of vaccines may not induce sufficient immune protection in everyone; therefore, other measures that complement vaccinations are essential for ending the COVID-19 pandemic.
COVID-19: Who is Most At Risk of Serious Illness?

When autocomplete results are available use up and down arrows to review and enter to select.
As many countries and areas are easing public health and social measures, governments, businesses, communities and individuals all play important roles in managing COVID-19.
This reflects a move from an acute pandemic response towards a sustained management approach, which aims to reduce the risk of serious illness, minimize deaths and protect health systems, while supporting ongoing social and economic recovery.
Now more than ever, all levels of society have specific roles to play, contributing to the broader goal of protecting people from COVID-19 in the longer term.
WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific, Dr Takeshi Kasai said, “When population-based measures are eased, it does not mean countries are giving up on controlling COVID-19.
Rather, governments and people will need to move to an approach that sustainably manages COVID-19 in the future.”
The sustained management approach for COVID-19 in the Western Pacific Region includes five key elements: vaccination, public health and social measures appropriately calibrated for the local context, protecting the health system, early detection and targeted response, and international border measures (again, appropriately calibrated for the context).
These should be supported by strong surveillance, contact tracing and monitoring, and clear communication.
“Now, governments need to reach every vulnerable person with vaccines, refine surveillance for effective decision-making, ensure health systems are arranged in a way to provide services to those who need them.
We must also clearly communicate with businesses, communities and individuals about what they need to know, so they can take the most appropriate action.”
Read Dr Kasai’s remarks on sustained management of COVID-19.
Reaching the unreached with vaccination
With high vaccination coverage of health-care workers across the Region, the focus must be on efforts to vaccinate every older person, every person with an underlying health condition, and everyone with a higher risk of infection or more difficulty in accessing health services.
This may include people living in remote or hard-to-access parts of a country.
“We cannot think of ourselves as separate from others.
One person who is not vaccinated or one person who has no access to health services represents an equity issue for our society.
We can’t just talk about our own vaccination; we must ensure that others are vaccinated as well.
Our own protection relies on other people’s protection,” said Dr Dulce Natividad, Associate Professor at the University of the Philippines during a vaccination drive in Manila for people experiencing homeless and survivors of gender-based violence
Targeting public health and social measures
Public health and social measures need continual adjustment, depending on the evolving local situation, to decrease transmission of the virus without causing major social or economic disruption.
Individuals should take measures when and where appropriate.
These include: keeping a safe distance from others, avoiding crowds and places that are not well ventilated, wearing a well-fitted mask covering the mouth and nose, cleaning hands regularly, and covering coughs and sneezes.
Situations calling for these measures include: when there is a surge in COVID-19 cases; when you are in closed, confined spaces; or when visiting older adults or people with underlying health conditions.
People need to know when to scale up these measures.
For example, during Ramadan festivities in Malaysia , WHO advised people on ways to be proactive and smart to protect themselves and those around them.
People should also be vaccinated against COVID-19.
Decision-makers who are responsible for workplaces, businesses, events and other gatherings need to take actions to keep settings safe, such as ensuring policies are in place to encourage physical distancing in markets, improving ventilation in factories and organizing events outdoors.
In the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, children have been able to keep learning thanks to a Safely Back to School campaign, which included multisectoral collaboration and community engagement, clear communication, and measures including masks, distancing, ventilation, cleaning and a “stay home when sick” policy.
Protecting the health system
Governments may choose to adopt population-based measures such as lockdowns, if there is widespread transmission of COVID-19 and low vaccination coverage, and a risk of crossing the “red line” where health systems are overwhelmed.
But, in the long term, these measures will be exceptional.
Instead, governments can rapidly calibrate a range of measures (which fall short of lockdowns – for example, compulsory masks in indoor venues) as needed, to minimize deaths and protect the health system’s ability to meet all community needs, not just those of people with COVID-19.
To protect health systems and reduce pressure on health-care workers, people who test positive but have no symptoms or only mild illness should isolate and recover at home .
This saves hospital beds for people who are more seriously ill, whether it is COVID-19 or other illness.
To help governments make the most effective use of their health systems, WHO in the Western Pacific Region has published technical advice on various topics:
managing hospital services , including maintaining essential routine health care and generating surge capacity;
• implementing telemedicine services during COVID-19; and
Ensuring early detection and targeted response
While diagnosing and counting every case, tracing every contact, or carrying out mass testing may no longer be necessary, it will remain important to detect cases and clusters early, especially among vulnerable populations, such as people who are older, have underlying health conditions or are at higher risk of severe infection.
Countries should ensure they have good systems for detecting cases in settings such as health-care facilities and care homes for older people, as well as among vulnerable communities, such as people living in overcrowded housing, refugees and migrants, people with disabilities, people living in poverty and people experiencing homelessness.

Modifying border measures
Governments have successfully implemented border measures to delay the introduction of COVID-19 and variants of concern into some countries and areas, while they prepared their health systems, rolled out and accelerated COVID-19 vaccination.
With the virus expected to continue circulating for some time and many borders now fully open, all countries should expect further cases.
Countries and areas should take measures to strengthen capacities for coordination and management of travellers at points of entry.

Facing future challenges
As long as the virus is in circulation, governments, businesses, communities and individuals need to stay vigilant and use a combination of tools to limit its spread and its impact.
If every part of society plays its role, appropriate to its context and specific setting, we can limit transmission, reduce the risk of the emergence of new and more dangerous variants, protect the most vulnerable and those at high risk, and allow people to return to living the lives that we all want.

Testing, testing, and more testing—it’s one of the most-discussed topics in the COVID-19 pandemic.
Getting it right is widely considered a crucial step in understanding and ending the pandemic.
A common refrain is that we simply need more of it in more places, but there’s a lot more to it than that.
There are several types of tests measuring different things, and new innovations and strategies are emerging all the time.
So, what tests are there?
How can they be improved?
How can we make better use of the ones we have?
What do we need to scale up to what’s needed?
What does the future hold?
To help explain the differences among tests and the different purposes they can serve, Yuka Manabe, MD, a Johns Hopkins expert in infectious diseases and testing, offered a survey of the current testing landscape in an interview with Stephanie Desmon for the Public Health On Call podcast.
Types of Diagnostic Tests
There are two main types of diagnostic tests: Molecular tests are the most accurate but usually are performed by lab technicians.
Antigen tests are fast and inexpensive but less accurate.
What they have in common:
Both are collected by throat, nasal swabs, and, in some cases, saliva/drool
Both issue a positive or negative result
While these tests tell you that the virus is present, they can’t tell you how “serious” a course of illness you might have
Both have rapid point-of-care options—which don’t require specialized lab work or trained staff
A Note on Variants: For the most part, diagnostic tests will not need to be changed to detect new variants.
Most diagnostic tests for COVID-19 do not look for the part of the virus that may be affected by mutations.
There are a few tests that have lost one target with certain viral variants, but because they have more than one target, will still detect the virus.
Therefore, it is better to use tests that have more than one molecular target.
Molecular Tests
What they do: These tests look for the virus’s genetic material and are the current standard for diagnosing COVID-19.
Method: Nasal or throat swab, and for some tests, saliva
Turnaround: Varies by type of test
Most testing sites use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests , which are very accurate but are usually performed in large certified labs and require skilled lab workers.
Results can take several days to come back.
, which are very accurate but are usually performed in large certified labs and require skilled lab workers.
Results can take several days to come back.
Rapid point-of-care molecular tests, such as Abbott’s ID NOW, can provide results within 13 minutes.
Other authorized platforms (Mesa Biotech, Cepheid, Liat, GenMark, Visby, Biofire, Cue) take from 20–120 minutes and are very easy to perform.
These tests can also be used outside traditional health care settings, and they are quickly becoming more widespread.
Accuracy: Some point-of-care molecular tests (particularly Abbott ID NOW) are less sensitive than reference lab tests.
Molecular tests do produce false negatives, but not very often.
False negatives are unlikely when a person has the most virus, which is usually in the first five days of symptoms.
Takeaway: If a molecular test said you were negative for the virus in the first week after you showed symptoms, you are probably not infected.
Further along in the illness, it may be more difficult to determine.
Antigen Tests
What they do: These rapid tests, which detect certain proteins on the surface or in the virus, are inexpensive, efficient, and fast.
Many of these tests have been FDA authorized for emergency use, some even in the home environment (Ellume).
They can be used to make a clinical diagnosis in symptomatic patients in the first five days of symptoms.
However, they aren’t currently recommended for screening asymptomatic populations.
Method: Nasal or throat swab
Turnaround: As fast as 10–15 minutes, or up to 30 minutes
Accuracy: False positive results are fairly unlikely with these tests when used as described above, but if you have symptoms and receive a negative antigen test result, you may still have COVID-19 and may need a molecular test for confirmation.
In asymptomatic people, data are more limited but the test is less accurate.
Takeaway:
Antigen tests would be very good screening tests for symptomatic patients early in illness—particularly in settings where access to a molecular tests is poor or where it takes a very long time to get results.
Screening of symptomatic pediatric patients who commonly get respiratory viruses may also be a good reason to use them.
Antibody (Serology) Tests
What they do: These tests detect antibodies that signal that the body has mounted an immune response to the virus.
They do not indicate whether a person has current COVID-19 infection, or when they were exposed.
Method: Blood sample
Timeline: 1–3 days, sometimes same day
Accuracy: Antibody tests detect whether you have antibodies to the virus, but not whether those are neutralizing antibodies, which are the best indicator that someone is protected from the virus.
(About 95% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 develop antibodies, but only around 80% develop neutralizing immunity.)
Very few labs in the U.S. have the capacity to analyze samples specifically for neutralizing antibodies.
Takeaway: Antibody tests are mainly used to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 in a certain population—what proportion has been infected, who may still be at risk, and who may be a potential donor of convalescent plasma, which is being studied as a potential COVID-19 treatment.
These tests can be useful for people who had telltale COVID-19 symptoms but received negative test results—perhaps because they were tested later in their illness—to determine whether they likely had COVID-19 in the past.
This testing should be done more than 14 days after symptoms—ideally at more than a month later.
Problems with Testing
All of the molecular and antigen tests require various components including swabs, vials, and “viral transport media”—the liquid the swab sits in while it’s being transported to a lab.
At some point during this pandemic, one or all of these components have been in short supply.
Because the outbreak has never been contained in the U.S., tests have been prioritized for medical care.
Supply chain issues continue to make testing challenging, so immediate solutions should focus on infection prevention to lower the need for tests.
Testing innovation could help in the longer term.
The Future of Testing
Measuring Infectiousness: Neither antigen nor molecular tests can tell if a person has infectious virus—meaning the virus is not only present but capable of invading cells and reproducing, causing an infection.
This is possible to measure—but very few labs are conducting these tests in the U.S. One of them is here at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
Because these tests involve growing the virus, they require highly specialized labs, and these tests are not available to the general public.
In the absence of widespread lab testing for infectivity, our best estimate of whether a person can transmit the virus is based on time: that most people will stop having infectious virus after about 12 days of symptoms.
In addition, you could also have infectious virus for two or three days before symptoms arise.
Innovative Testing: Nasal and throat swabs are uncomfortable—and that’s particularly problematic for those who have to get tested frequently—so researchers are studying less invasive methods such as breath-based tests, and are working to refine saliva tests.
Pooled Testing: With super-sensitive PCR tests, a group of specimens can be “batched” and tested together instead of tested individually, to indicate whether anyone in that group is infected.
If the pooled test is positive, individuals can then be tested.
This method, which has already been deployed in low-resource settings, is gaining more attention as a way to give more mileage to limited testing supplies, because it can rule out the need to test many people individually.
It works best in areas with low prevalence of the virus.

The novel coronavirus has accelerated the use of many digital technologies.
Forced in the spring to close their doors, most K-12 schools and universities shifted to online learning where teachers lead classes virtually and students submit their assignments electronically.
According to the World Economic Forum, it is estimated that 1.2 billion students around the world this year were “out of the classroom” due to the pandemic, while in the United States, over 55 million K-12 students didn’t receive in-person instruction.
The use of telemedicine and video conferencing also has become a principal platform for medical consultations as a result of the coronavirus.
For example, a Forrester analysis projected “general medical care visits to top 200 million this year, up sharply from their original expectation of 36 million visits for all of 2020.”
Virtual connections allow patients to get recommendations wherever they are and draw on a broad range of medical expertise.
E-commerce is taking off as consumers abandon small retail outlets and large department stores.
An industry study found that “total online spending in May 2020 reached $82.5 billion, up 77% from May of 2019” and those numbers almost surely will increase in coming months as people appreciate the convenience of online ordering and home delivery.
Yet the pandemic also has exposed dramatic inequities in technology access and utilization.
Not everyone has the high-speed broadband required for online education, telemedicine and online shopping.
The Federal Communications Commission has estimated it would take $40 billion to close the bulk of the broadband gap.
But many people also lack laptops, notebooks, smartphones or electronic devices that allow them to stream videos and take advantage of new modes of service delivery.
It is not just that some are outside the online world, but that digital access is spread inequitably across various groups.
According to an Education Week survey, 64% of American teachers and administrators in schools with a large number of low-income students said their pupils faced technology limitations, compared to only 21% of students in schools with a small number of low-income students.
The problem isn’t simply broadband, but access to equipment and devices that allow pupils to make use of online resources.
There are substantial racial disparities as well.
A McKinsey analysis found that 40% of African-American students and 30% of Hispanic students in U.S. K-12 schools received no online instruction during COVID-induced school shutdowns, compared to 10% of whites.
These gaps in access to online education and digital services widen the already substantial educational inequalities that exist, but push them to new heights.
If continued for a lengthy period of time, such differentials expose our most disadvantaged students to large barriers to advancement and a future of income deprivation or economic stagnation.
Even more tragic, there may be a tipping point beyond which the gap is no longer recoverable.
These types of inequities are intolerable injustices that create nearly insoluble gaps with serious social and economic consequences.
The variations noted above increase income inequality, widen the opportunity gap between social groups and doom those left behind to low-paying jobs, temporary positions without health benefits or outright unemployment.
Not having access to the digital superhighway limits opportunities for online education, telemedicine and e-commerce and makes it nearly impossible to apply for jobs, request government benefits or access needed health or educational materials.
What is required right now is investment in digital infrastructure and improvements in digital access that eliminate unfair disparities based on race, income and geography.
For example, the Federal Communications Commission needs to expand its current “Lifeline” program designed to promote phone connectivity for poor people to the internet.
Many providers combine phone and internet usage so there is no reason to provide subsidies for phone service without also including internet service.
With the availability of Voice over Internet Protocols (VoIP), it is easy for underserved people to combine phone and internet connectivity.
This FCC also should expand its “Schools and Libraries” program called “E-rate” to include home schooling and remote learning.
With so many educational institutions closed and providing instruction through online education, the commission should use the millions in unexpended program funds to close the “homework gap” created by the COVID-19 pandemic.
That would help impoverished students access online resources and video conferencing facilities.
The Department of Agriculture’s Rural Utilities Service seeks to improve broadband service in rural areas but its funding currently cannot be used to improve low-speed broadband.
At a time when many lack sufficient speed to access online educational resources, telemedicine or video streaming, that limitation makes little sense and needs to be altered so that rural-dwellers can upgrade their internet service.
In the education sphere, states and localities must ensure that racial and income-based disparities in access to online learning are not a permanent feature of the K-12 landscape.
Addressing this issue is going to require much more than distributing free laptops to needy students, as is often advocated.
Rather, it will involve making sure families can afford the broadband access that will enable pupils to use the laptops in productive ways, teachers are well-trained in distance learning and educational programs equip young people with the skills needed in the 21st century economy.
As we move into the future, broadband will be as vital to social and economic advancement as highways, bridges and dams were in earlier eras.
Similar to the 20th century, improving access requires national planning and public and private sector investments.
Indeed, digital access should be considered a human right in the same manner as access to universal healthcare.
People cannot participate in the digital economy and online learning systems without high-speed broadband.
As noted in our recent AI book, the United States requires a national plan that funds digital infrastructure, reduces racial and geographic disparities, facilitates universal medical insurance and prepares workers for the digital economy.
The list of national imperatives includes closing the digital divide, expanding anti-bias rules for the digital economy, building an inclusive economy through more equitable tax policies and training the next generation of workers.
New digital services or financial transactions taxes could help fund the programs that need to be undertaken to deal with these issues.
One hundred years ago, as the United States underwent industrialization, national leaders adopted an income tax to pay for needed services, and as we move into a digital economy, there will need to be new types of taxes to pay for needed expenditures.
We cannot allow current inequities in access to education and healthcare to deny opportunities to African-Americans, Hispanics, immigrants and poor people.
Leaving those individuals behind as the digital economy grows is not a viable option if we’re ever as a nation to achieve our full potential by empowering all Americans.
Data is the key to many emerging technologies so it is crucial to have unbiased information to develop new services, evaluate digital innovation and deal with the ramifications of current products.
Much of the current digital data is proprietary in nature and therefore limits the ability of researchers to improve innovation, close the digital divide and develop remedies that address equity problems.
The federal government sits on a trove of data that should be made available for commercial and research purposes on an anonymized basis so that privacy is maintained.
In the same way that census data enables research, economic development and program assessment, wider access to digital data likely would spur new products and services while also helping to address equity problems.
In a country that continues to be plagued by the coronavirus, it is vital to reduce the inequities that deny opportunity to large groups of Americans and make it impossible for them to share in the benefits of the digital revolution.
As we envision a post-COVID world, it is essential we build an inclusive economy that allows everyone to participate in and gain the benefits of the online world.
The fundamental shifts wrought by COVID are not going to slow even after a vaccine is developed and the effects of the coronavirus dissipate over time.
Nearly all of the technological trends generated by COVID this year will remain a large part of our ongoing landscape.
Due to advances in computer storage and processing power, 5G networks and the growing use of data analytics, technology innovation almost certainly will accelerate in coming years.
Having a substantial part of our fellow citizens outside the digital environment is a recipe for continued racial injustice, social conflict, economic deprivation and political division.
It will ensure that cynicism, discontent and anger will remain a feature of the American social landscape for decades to come.
The last four years have exposed the massive inequities in American society, made worse not only by the intentional political polarization of the American public, but also by a digital divide that is virtually certain to lock in many pernicious dimensions of inequality in America.
This is not a technology problem, it’s a leadership challenge.
Leadership can solve this national crisis by demonstrating the will to wield technology in the best interests of all Americans.
The next administration has it within its capacity to address these matters head on and eliminate this divide, or conversely, if it doesn’t take appropriate action, condemn our most vulnerable citizens to four more years of neglect and inequity.
COLUMBUS, Kan. (AP) — Students spread out in their rural Kansas classroom, answering questions with a partner about invaders atop elephants attempting to sack Rome more than 2,000 years ago.
“Do you want to read?”
one of the third graders, Parker, asked his partner after the lesson on the Punic Wars.
“Because I’m not really good.”
Bekah Noel told her students to jot down answers for their partners if they needed extra help writing or spelling.
Halfway through the school year, with some of her students reading nearly 200 words per minute and others struggling to sound out around 10, she has had to make a lot of tweaks like this.
Exiting from the pandemic, the assumption might be that Noel’s students should be among the least scathed.
The tiny, 900-student school system in Columbus pivoted to remote learning briefly in March 2020 before going back in person that fall, initially without masks.
While some U.S. students spent a year or more learning online, pandemic school in rural Kansas was as normal as it got.

Otherwise, Parker said, he would “squirrel off.”

But the upheaval still took a toll.
Students and teachers got sick, social distancing made it hard to teach kids in small groups, and the pace of teaching ground to a crawl.
Three years later, Noel has more third graders than ever who are reading below grade level.
That’s the true elephant in the room.
“I have kids,” Noel said midway through the year, “that legitimately cannot read.”
Noel is used to adapting to students’ needs, and she has been pulling out all the strategies in her toolkit.

As the pandemic was raging, the district also adopted a new strategy: a reading curriculum that is heavy on phonics — a stressful gamble that the science-backed curriculum might help kids catch up.
There are signs the changes are helping, particularly for older students.
Educators from other schools have been coming to observe the changes.
But this is third grade, the last year students are typically taught to read.
And time is running out.

AS VIRUS SPREAD, ‘EVERYBODY WAS STRESSED OUT’
During a group session in October, third grader Emmett Mayfield and a classmate dismantled the word “athletic” with paraprofessional Jessica Seitz.
Columbus used federal pandemic relief money to double the number of paraprofessionals assigned to help its small groups of struggling students.
“How many syllables do we have?”
she asked.
Emmett answered: “Three.”
It was part of a lesson on closed syllables, a term that refers to a vowel being followed by a consonant.
This matters because it creates a short vowel sound, meaning the letter “A” in the word is pronounced as “ah.”
If it was a long vowel, it would sound more like the name of the letter.
“Make a fist,” Seitz instructed.
“We are closing that door.
The consonant is stopping that vowel from saying its name.”
This type of lesson is a common one now that the district emphasizes the so-called science of reading that is gaining momentum nationwide.
Schools piloted two new reading curriculums for a few weeks in November and December of 2020, as COVID-19 case levels soared.
Spared initially, small towns in rural Kansas were so overwhelmed that hospitals had to fly patients hundreds of miles away for treatment.
Parker’s mom, Chelsea Brinson, a medical assistant, was testing droves of COVID samples at a clinic.
“Everybody was stressed out,” said Brinson, who now works as a nurse’s assistant in the district.
Federal data shows disruptions wrought by the pandemic were accompanied by widespread learning setbacks, even in states where students returned quickly to in-person learning.
Some of the largest learning losses are in this year's third graders.

Students started masking.
But that meant mask breaks were added to the already disrupted schedule.
Reading specialist Kelly Walters asked the overwhelmed teachers whether they wanted to put the reading pilot on hold.
“One hundred percent of our staff said, ‘No, we want to move forward,’” recalled Walters, who struggled so much to learn to read herself that she suspects an undiagnosed case of dyslexia was to blame.
The program they picked weaves phonics and other reading changes throughout the curriculum.
No longer are those elements mostly isolated to worksheets.
Staff praised it, which was encouraging to Walters, who tested the materials on her youngest child, just 3 at the time, while stuck at home early in the pandemic.
“As a mom, who was a struggling reader, to give that gift —” she said, and then stopped and corrected herself.
“I shouldn’t have said it was a gift, because it’s not a gift.
It’s a right.”

THIRD GRADERS WERE READING LIKE FIRST GRADERS
In late November, Noel taught a science lesson on the skeletal system.
Like the rest of the curriculum, it also incorporated reading instruction, with “structure” among the vocabulary words she highlighted.
“Have you ever seen a house being built before?”
Noel asked.
The students blurted out examples before she continued: “And they’ll have the wood up first, and it will be like beams.”
She then asked whether the word “structure” was a noun, verb, adjective or adverb.
Why, she then asked, was it one of the vocabulary words in a lesson on the skeletal system?
Parker shared his answer: “Because our spine holds up the rest of our body.”
Noel rewarded him with a fist bump.
Parker started the year reading at the level of a first grader.
He was, Noel, said, “embarrassed.”
Midway through the year he seemed stuck, learning new skills and then seeming to forget it all.
Staff were worried.
He was flagged for a special education assessment.
When the pandemic first closed schools in 2020, Parker was a kindergartener.
His mom recalled “freaking out,” trying to figure out what to do with him.
To get him to do schoolwork, his grandmother or someone else had to sit beside him at all times.
Otherwise, Parker said, he would “squirrel off.”
Columbus and many other rural school systems reopened that fall.
With strong opposition to masks locally, the district instead added “sneeze guards” to desks.
But in-person school was far from normal.
The pandemic had hobbled one of teachers’ most effective tools: small groups.
Typically, they would pull kids from different classes to create groups targeting specific skills, Noel said.
But with COVID, they were trying to keep each of the classes separated to limit the spread of disease.
And then there was COVID itself.
Between illnesses and quarantines, students and staff were missing two weeks or more of school multiple times throughout the year.
“It was taking us two days to do something that would have taken us one,” Noel said.
Noel was infected twice, forced to miss school again just this past fall because of a COVID-sickened child.
Parker caught COVID in first grade, missing two weeks of school.
Across the country, federal data show, the disruptions wrought by the pandemic were accompanied by widespread learning setbacks, even in states that saw students return quickly to in-person learning.
Among those showing the largest learning losses are this year’s crop of third graders, who were in kindergarten when the pandemic hit, a foundational year for learning to read.
Now Noel’s students and other third graders are under pressure to master reading ahead of later grades, where literacy is key to learning everything else.

KIDS START CATCHING UP, BUT SLOWLY
By late January, it was time to show off at “Books and Breakfast,” with parents, grandparents, preschool-age siblings and friends visiting Highland School to see what the children were learning.
The students sprawled around the school building, eating doughnuts and reading books to their special guests.
As Emmett read aloud from “Grumpy Monkey,” he got some help with the word “discovery” and plowed ahead, reading clearly how the bananas were “too sweet.”
“I used to didn’t like to read,” said Emmett, who started the year reading more like an early second grader, “but I just started reading.”
At home, though, he is still resisting reading, said his mother, Jessica Mayfield, a 39-year-old hospital lab technician.
She blames it in part on those “awful” days of virtual learning.
There were meltdowns, and she fretted even then that he would fall behind, with those early years of school so “crucial.”
Mayfield, herself an avid reader, doesn’t know what more the district could have done.
“I think,” she said, “it’s just to be expected.”
Assessments showed 13 of Noel’s 24 students are reading below grade level.
Many of them are kids who moved to the district in the middle of this school year.
Nine have been getting the most intensive so-called tier-three level of support.
Some of her students scored so highly they were evaluated for the gifted program.
In a rarity, none fell in the middle tier group of kids needing just a little extra help.
It’s a trend seen elsewhere around the country as the pandemic widened the gap between higher- and lower-performing students.
Noel is working harder than ever to keep her advanced students from getting bored, assigning them special projects.
Grace Epler, an advanced reader who is prone to finishing assignments early, sometimes spends her free time making up math problems, helping her classmates or playing educational games on her iPad.
State tests are looming, and it weighs heavily on Grace.
“They compare this school to all the other elementary schools in Kansas, and it scares me,” she said at lunchtime, her wrist in a pink splint after a swing mishap.
“I might get, like, five wrong.”
This even though she reads nearly anything put in front of her.
She is particularly partial to a book the kids wrote and illustrated themselves that documented what they will miss most about their soon-to-close school, a building filled with quirks like a toilet in an old shower stall.
Many kids in Noel’s class are progressing, but not as much as she would like.
“Those highs grew even more,” Noel said.
“And the lows, they grew, but they’re still quite a bit lower.”

READING ‘ACTUALLY’ BECOMES FUN
One day in April, Emmett and Parker were taking a turn in the small group getting extra reading help.
After talk of the basketball and softball seasons, the small group took turns reading a book called “A Prince Among Donkeys,” with lots of words and spelling patterns they’ve seen before.
Parker rested his hand on his forehead, reading: “To Adam’s surprise, Emma smelled.”
Then, a quick correction: “smelled” to “smiled.”
Imperfect though it was, something had happened over these months of phonics drills and small-group work.
When the special education testing came back, not only did it show he didn’t qualify, but he also made so much progress he was close to reading at the level of a beginning third grader.
“I actually do like reading now,” Parker explained.
He described evenings spent on the couch with his mother, practicing.
He and Emmett are now obsessed with the same book series about a superhero cat.
“It’s just fun to do.”
When Parker finished his turn reading, he had the choice of picking who would go next.
But he didn’t choose Emmett or any of the other kids.
“Can I pick myself?” he asked.
And he kept reading.

New World Bank report calls for urgent fiscal stimulus and economic reforms to help the poor and the most vulnerable in Iraq
Baghdad, November 11, 2020 –
The twin shocks of COVID-19 pandemic and the collapse of oil prices have caused significant economic challenges and pushed millions of Iraqis into poverty, according to the new issue of the World Bank’s Iraq Economic Monitor.
The new Fall 2020 edition of the Iraq Economic Monitor titled “Protecting Vulnerable Iraqis in the Time of a Pandemic: The Case for Urgent Stimulus and Economic Reforms” finds that even under a benign impact scenario, up to 5.5 million more Iraqis could fall into poverty due to the twin crises.
Furthermore, the potential reduction of the public wage bill and pensions could push an additional 0.4 to 1.7 million Iraqis into poverty unless the rightsizing exercise is introduced in a progressive and efficient fashion.
The economic monitor estimates that Iraq’s GDP is set to contract by 9.5% in 2020.
While oil production plummeted to a five-years low, Iraq’s economy contracted by 6.8% during the first half of the year; of which non-oil GDP contracted by 9.2% as lockdowns and other COVID-19 related containment measures affected services sectors.
According to the report, the Iraqi government revenues fell by 47.5% in the first 8 months of 2020 while expenditures remained high as a result of the public wage bill and pensions.
Such budget rigidities put pressure on government financing needs which are expected to reach a staggering 25.8% of GDP by end of 2020.
Multiple security and economic crises in recent years have left unequal imprints across regions and groups in Iraq, yet the horizon on the country’s economic outlook revolves around the global prospects of the oil markets and the capacity of the healthcare sector to cope with the pandemic.
Conscious of the situation, the Government approved in October 2020 a comprehensive policy and reform White Paper which sets out a blueprint for reforms over the next 3 to 5 years that if implemented could mark a turning point for Iraq’s economy.
The White Paper aims to rebalance the economy and put it back on track by enabling the state in taking necessary actions to create a dynamic and diversified economy.
This in turn leads to the creation of jobs for citizens to have a decent living.
“The magnitude of economic challenges facing Iraq need a long-term solution and long overdue structural reforms,” said Saroj Kumar Jha, World Bank Mashreq Regional Director.
“The reforms outlined in the Government's White Paper, if implemented, will boost job creation, especially in the private sector, as well as economic growth, which are key to improving the livelihood of Iraqis.
"
There are large economic gains to be made through the implementation of the long-awaited reforms.
The World Bank simulates that such reforms could add as much as 58.4% to Iraq’s per capita GDP growth.
Overall, the ultimate success of this reform initiative is dependent on the political will and the garnering of public support to lead Iraq out of the fragility trap that it has been grappling with for so long.
The policy response requires working towards health and livelihood protection in the short term, including usage of tools like cash transfers, public works, or active labor market programs, but also addressing structural issues through a deeper reforms program.
Burnout among physicians and other health professionals is not a newly recognized crisis.
But the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated burnout and presented unique challenges for physicians and other health professionals, according to a national survey.
Physician burnout demands urgent action The AMA is leading the national effort to solve the growing physician burnout crisis.
We're working to eliminate the dysfunction in health care by removing the obstacles and burdens that interfere with patient care.
Learn About Our Ongoing Work
Published in The Lancet open-access journal EClinicalMedicine, “Prevalence and correlates of stress and burnout among U.S. healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A national cross-sectional survey study,” was co-written by researchers from the AMA and Hennepin Healthcare.
Between May 28 and Oct. 1, 2020, using the AMA Coping with COVID-19 for Caregivers Survey, 20,947 health professionals from 42 health care organizations across the U.S. assessed their workers’ stress during the pandemic.
The survey found that 61% of those surveyed felt high fear of exposing themselves or their families to COVID-19 while 38% self-reported experiencing anxiety or depression.
Another 43% suffered from work overload and 49% had burnout.
Stress scores were highest among nursing assistants, medical assistants, social workers, inpatient workers, women, and among Black and Latinx people.
But odds of burnout were 40% lower in those who felt valued by their organizations, which was 46% of respondents.
“We’ve been really trying to focus our work and our mental models about the COVID crisis as an opportunity for us to reset health care,” Kyra Cappelucci, a coauthor and project administrator for AMA Practice Transformation, said during an AMA STEPS Forward™ webinar on well-being and burnout during COVID-19.
“Some of the changes we’ve seen within health systems focus on individual resiliency and helping people connect to what resiliency means to them, but it’s also certainly a time for us to reexamine our operations and our team structures … so that we can support the well-being of everyone in health care,” Cappelucci said.
Here are five solutions to keep in mind to improve well-being and reduce burnout during—and after—the pandemic.

Having healthy food easily available was “rated highest as a helpful intervention for people who were working in an ER or ICU setting,” said Cappelucci.
“In the first month or two of the pandemic, this is where a lot of the wellness efforts were focused on: thinking about personal and family safety.”
This included “having explanations for how people can safely go home to their families and not expose their families since fear of exposure was so high in the early days,” she said.
Read about six ways to address physician stress during COVID-19 pandemic.
Streamline communications Streamline communications
“Some groups want to hear just from their CEO
[and] some groups only want to hear from their department chairs,” said Cappelucci.
“We had organizations create checklists for leaders around how to be transparent and clear in communications, and really acknowledging the uncertainty in those communications.”
Organizations also normalized “the wide range of emotions that were happening” while “being a visible presence in rounding,” she added.
Allow for reflection and processing Allow for reflection and processing
The concept of peer support has grown more “popular this year than we were used to seeing,” said Cappelucci, adding that “almost every group we work with has at least some kind of formal or informal peer-support program.”
This means creating opportunities “for people to have shared experiences and talk about what they’ve gone through over this past year,” she said, noting that this could, and likely will, extend beyond the pandemic.
Discover how a peer-support program strives to ease distress during pandemic.
Make it OK to get help Make it OK to get help
Sixty-six percent of all respondents noted that personal access to mental health care would be helpful during times of crisis like the pandemic.
This also highlights the need to normalize help-seeking and ensuring that access to mental health support is available and easy to access.
Make “sure that there is accessible information about what’s available to your employees around mental health,” said Cappelucci.
“A lot of groups did this through just having an intranet site—just one page where people could go to find what options were available to them.”

“Everyone seeks help in a different way, so making a diverse array of opportunities available and then making it accessible and clear for how they can access that was important,” she said.
Measure and share results Measure and share results
“You can't fix what you don't measure,” said Cappelucci.
“We really encourage organizations to not only collect those data, but to share them transparently.”
It is important to take “the effort to hold a town hall or to somehow share some of those data so that people know that the organization has seen and heard them,” she said.

Heavy hearts soared Monday with news that Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate — the frontrunner in the American market — seemed to be generating an immune response in Phase 1 trial subjects.
The company’s stock valuation also surged, hitting $29 billion, an astonishing feat for a company that currently sells zero products.
But was there good reason for so much enthusiasm?
Several vaccine experts asked by STAT concluded that, based on the information made available by the Cambridge, Mass.-based company, there’s really no way to know how impressive — or not — the vaccine may be.

While Moderna blitzed the media, it revealed very little information — and most of what it did disclose were words, not data.
That’s important: If you ask scientists to read a journal article, they will scour data tables, not corporate statements.
With science, numbers speak much louder than words.
Even the figures the company did release don’t mean much on their own, because critical information — effectively the key to interpreting them — was withheld.
Experts suggest we ought to take the early readout with a big grain of salt.
Here are a few reasons why.
advertisement
The silence of the NIAID
The National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases has partnered with Moderna on this vaccine.
Scientists at NIAID made the vaccine’s construct, or prototype, and the agency is running the Phase 1 trial.
This week’s Moderna readout came from the earliest of data from the NIAID-led Phase 1.
NIAID doesn’t hide its light under a bushel.
The institute generally trumpets its findings, often offering director Anthony Fauci — who, fair enough, is pretty busy these days — or other senior personnel for interviews.
But NIAID did not put out a press release Monday and declined to provide comment on Moderna’s announcement.
The n = 8 thing
The company’s statement led with the fact that all 45 subjects (in this analysis) who received doses of 25 micrograms (two doses each), 100 micrograms (two doses each), or a 250 micrograms (one dose) developed binding antibodies.

Privacy Policy
Later, the statement indicated that eight volunteers — four each from the 25-microgram and 100-microgram arms — developed neutralizing antibodies.
Of the two types, these are the ones you’d really want to see.
We don’t know results from the other 37 trial participants.
This doesn’t mean that they didn’t develop neutralizing antibodies.
Testing for neutralizing antibodies is more time-consuming than other antibody tests and must be done in a biosecurity level 3 laboratory.
Moderna disclosed the findings from eight subjects because that’s all it had at that point.
Still, it’s a reason for caution.
Separately, while the Phase 1 trial included healthy volunteers ages 18 to 55 years, the exact ages of these eight people are unknown.
If, by chance, they mostly clustered around the younger end of the age spectrum, you might expect a better response to the vaccine than if they were mostly from the senior end of it.
And given who is at highest risk from the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, protecting older adults is what Covid-19 vaccines need to do.
There’s no way to know how durable the response will be
The report of neutralizing antibodies in subjects who were vaccinated comes from blood drawn two weeks after they received their second dose of vaccine.
Two weeks.
“That’s very early.
We don’t know if those antibodies are durable,” said Anna Durbin, a vaccine researcher at Johns Hopkins University.
There’s no real way to contextualize the findings
Moderna stated that the antibody levels seen were on a par with — or greater than, in the case of the 100-microgram dose — those seen in people who have recovered from Covid-19 infection.
But studies have shown antibody levels among people who have recovered from the illness vary enormously; the range may be influenced by the severity of a person’s disease.
John “Jack” Rose, a vaccine researcher from Yale University, pointed STAT to a study from China that showed that, among 175 recovered Covid-19 patients studied, 10 had no detectable neutralizing antibodies.
Recovered patients at the other end of the spectrum had really high antibody levels.
So though the company said the antibody levels induced by vaccine were as good as those generated by infection, there’s no real way to know what that comparison means.
STAT asked Moderna for information on the antibody levels it used as a comparator.
The response: That will be disclosed in an eventual journal article from NIAID, which is part of the National Institutes of Health.
“The convalescent sera levels are not being detailed in our data readout, but would be expected in a downstream full data exposition with NIH and its academic collaborators,” Colleen Hussey, the company’s senior manager for corporate communications, said in an email.
Durbin was struck by the wording of the company’s statement, pointing to this sentence: “The levels of neutralizing antibodies at day 43 were at or above levels generally seen in convalescent sera.”
“I thought: Generally?
What does that mean?”
Durbin said.
Her question, for the time being, can’t be answered.
Rose said the company should disclose the information.
“When a company like Moderna with such incredibly vast resources says they have generated SARS-2 neutralizing antibodies in a human trial, I would really like to see numbers from whatever assay they are using,” he said.
Moderna’s approach to disclosure
The company has not yet brought a vaccine to market, but it has a variety of vaccines for infectious diseases in its pipeline.
It doesn’t publish on its work in scientific journals.
What is known has been disclosed through press releases.
That’s not enough to generate confidence within the scientific community.
“My guess is that their numbers are marginal or they would say more,” Rose said about the company’s SARS-2 vaccine, echoing a suspicion that others have about some of the company’s other work.
“I do think it’s a bit of a concern that they haven’t published the results of any of their ongoing trials that they mention in their press release.
They have not published any of that,” Durbin noted.
Still, she characterized herself as “cautiously optimistic” based on what the company has said so far.
“I would like to see the data to make my own interpretation of the data.
But I think it is at least encouraging that we’ve seen immune responses with this RNA vaccine that we haven’t seen with previous RNA vaccines for other pathogens.
Whether it’s going to be enough, we don’t know,” Durbin said.
Moderna has been more forthcoming with data on at least one of its other vaccine candidates.
In a statement issued in January about a Phase 1 trial for its cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine, it quantified how far over baseline measures antibody levels rose in vaccines.
For decades, technologists have trumpeted the potential for the internet and personal computers to transform the modern workplace, leading to widescale working from home and a reduction in the need for office space.
Building on these observations, a growing body of research has also explored the potential benefits of remote work to employers and employees alike.
In some situations, remote working has in fact been shown to improve employee productivity.
For instance, in a recent experiment the Chinese travel website Ctrip had call centre employees volunteer to have the opportunity to work from home.
A randomly selected subset of the volunteers was allowed to work from home, while the rest served as a control group.
In the experiment, those that were allowed to work from home were more productive and reported higher satisfaction (Bloom et al. 2015, Bloom 2014).
Remote working has also been raised as a way to create more inclusive workplaces.
Mas and Pallais (2017), for example, suggest that women with young children place a higher premium on flexibility associated with remote working.
Yet, while there has been a rise in remote working, there are many challenges to broader adoption – ranging from workplace norms and stigma, to the need for effective management of remote teams (Neeley 2015, 2020), to more general productivity benefits of in-person work that are difficult to replicate remotely (due to unplanned physical workplace interactions, for example).
Moreover, there are important logistical constraints and remote working is simply not feasible for some jobs.
In a recent paper, Dingel and Neiman (2020) construct an occupation-level classification of the feasibility of doing different jobs from home.
They find that overall, roughly 37% of jobs have the potential to be done from home – but considerable variation exists across occupations.
In practice, many businesses that could implement remote working policies still choose not to.
The COVID-19 crisis has led to renewed interest in remote working, as businesses face a bleak set of options: continue business as usual but with the risk of grave illness, shut down the business, or transition to working from home.
To understand exactly how businesses are adjusting to the crisis, we have been surveying thousands of small businesses – representing a wide set of industries, firm sizes, and regions across the US.
In one paper (Bartik et al. 2020a), we find (among other results) that 43% of small businesses had temporarily shut down even just a few weeks into the crisis.
In another paper (Bartik et al. 2020b), we look directly at decisions about working from home across thousands of businesses, both large and small.
One sample comes from surveys conducted via Alignable, the largest network of small businesses in North America.
A second sample comes from the National Association for Business Economists (NABE), the leading association of economists in business and government.
We find that roughly 45% of small businesses had at least some of their employees move to remote work during the crisis, where working remotely is defined as working from home at least two days a week.
The NABE sample shows qualitatively similar increases or larger firms.
Findings in related work with employees as the unit of analysis by Bick et al. (2020) and Brynjolfsson et al. (2020) are broadly consistent with these large increases in working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.
This suggests that many businesses did in fact have at least some capacity to transition to remote working.
However, we find that the transition to remote working is uneven, with considerable variation in how businesses have been able to transition to remote working across industries.
To assess the variation, we draw on Dingel and Neiman’s index of suitability for remote work, which was constructed using attributes of the occupation (such as whether you need to have face-to-face interactions).
We find this does a remarkable job of predicting which industries adopted remote working during the crisis.
Figure 1 Probability of reporting a switch to remote work in March/April (Alignable survey) and the share of industry employees capable of working remotely (Dingel and Neiman 2020)
This suggests that feasibility was a real constraint and that businesses that were more able to go remote did in fact choose to do so.
In other words, the question isn’t just whether businesses can transition to remote work, but which businesses can.
Our results also suggest the ways in which this transition may exacerbate inequality: businesses in industries with higher income and better educated employees were more likely to transition to remote work.
We then analysed the productivity of businesses, looking at the reports of owners (in the Alignable survey) and of economists working in businesses (in the NABE survey) about productivity changes.
Our results suggest that the productivity effects are also uneven, with many firms also becoming less productive as a result of the transition.
Looking at a sample of thousands of small businesses, this variation can also be predicted by an a priori classification of suitability for remote work, with more productivity losses among firms that were a priori classified as having less capacity for remote work.
Lastly, we analyse businesses expectations about the future of remote work at their companies and the extent to which they expect higher levels of remote work to persist even after the COVID-19 crisis.
Among NABE survey respondents, roughly 36% believe that more than 40% of workers who had switched to remote working during the COVID-19 crisis would continue working remotely after the crisis ends.
Among the Alignable respondents, roughly 40% of firms thought that 40% of more of their workers that switched to remote working during the COVID-19 crisis would continue working remotely after the crisis ends.
Despite the uneven productivity effects in the short run, this suggests that remote work is likely to remain at higher levels even after the crisis, and that the COVID-19 crisis may have a persistent impact on the nature of work.

Washington, D.C., August 14, 2020 (PAHO) — While Countries of the Americas have implemented innovative strategies to boost immunization programs during the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns about risk of exposure, as well as challenges accessing services during lockdown, have led to a reduction in vaccination coverage, a series of internal surveys from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) show.
The surveys were conducted with PAHO immunization program consultants in 16 countries in Latin America, and 22 countries in the Caribbean, and show that as lockdown policies have declined and relaxed, the provision of regular vaccination services has increased.
This is due to the implementation of measures including drive-through vaccination, mobile vaccination centers, vaccination in homes and other strategic locations such as banks and empty schools, as well as digital communication to emphasize the importance of immunization during a pandemic.
Despite these efforts, however, the Summary of the Status of National Immunization Programs during the COVID-19 Pandemic reveals that public concern around the risk of exposure to COVID-19 has affected demand for vaccination services.
Other issues, such as lockdown or physical distancing, as well as limitations in public transport have also led to a reduction in vaccination coverage and an increase in existing gaps.
Reports from 23 countries reveal a decrease of between 12% and 14% in the number of doses of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine (DTP) and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine administered to children when compared to the same period last year, particularly in March.
Dr. Cuauhtemoc Ruiz Matus, Head of PAHO’s Immunization program, emphasized the need for “countries to continue to implement innovative measures and strategies to reach those who have not been vaccinated.”
He also called for more initiatives in social communication “to transmit messages to the population regarding the importance of immunization in keeping people healthy and protected from vaccine-preventable diseases.”
In the survey, participants from 17 countries reported an impact on epidemiological surveillance due to a shift in priorities towards SARSCoV-2 cases.
However, other factors such as human resources dedicated to respond to the pandemic, reduced field investigations and screenings for vaccine-preventable diseases, as well as a halt in the shipment of samples for analysis, have also impacted surveillance.
Survey participants also indicate that case reporting has decreased significantly.
The closure of international borders and problems with international transport has also led to difficulties in the delivery of vaccines and supplies for national immunization programs, with surveys from 18 countries (47%) reporting issues in this area.
Of those that responded from 38 countries, 12 also emphasized disruption to laboratory services due to the reprioritization of work towards diagnosing COVID-19 cases.
The publication analyzed the results of surveys carried out every two weeks from April until 6 July 2020.
The surveys show that routine vaccination services have slowly increased in the last months.
All respondents reported in the most recent survey that vaccination services were open.

People who sell or present false proof of a COVID-19 vaccination would be subject to criminal charges under legislation heard today by the Senate Law & Justice Committee.
“I can’t imagine a worse time for someone to falsify proof of a vaccination than during a pandemic, as we’re facing now,” said Sen. Jesse Salomon (D-Shoreline).
“This is the most serious public health threat of our lifetimes, a true life-and-death issue for people who are medically vulnerable or unable to get vaccinated due to health issues.”
Under Salomon’s Senate Bill 5667, it would be a class C felony to sell or offer false documentation of a vaccination.
Presenting false documentation would be a misdemeanor.
COVID-19 vaccination cards are distributed by authorized health care providers when recipients receive vaccinations, but U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers have seized thousands of fraudulent vaccination cards at international mail facilities and at express consignment facilities.
Salomon noted that his bill does not address mandates or whether vaccinations are required at workplaces or at public venues, but focuses solely on whether a vaccination document has been falsified.
The bill is scheduled for executive action on Thursday.
“This is simply about truth in advertising and honest documentation,” he said.
“People who are medically vulnerable or who want to avoid exposure to the virus deserve to know that documentation of a vaccination can be trusted.”
CNN —
In February, it seemed like India had gotten Covid-19 under control, with daily cases falling nearly 90% from the peak of the first wave last year.
Now, the country is experiencing the world’s worst outbreak, with new cases surging past 400,000 per day and breaking the record for the highest single-day figure globally.
On the ground, these numbers translate to heart-wrenching tragedy.

Hospitals have run out of basic medical supplies, with many patients dying due to oxygen shortages.

The government scrambled to respond to the crisis, with countries around the world offering aid.
“There are some epidemiological estimates that say we are closing in on a peak, but these are all projections,” said Chandrika Bahadur, chair of the Lancet Covid-19 Commission India Task Force, on May 3.
“So it’s hard to tell whether the peak will come in the middle of May … or whether it will take a little bit longer.”
But even if the wave peaks and daily case figures decline, scientists warn that the country will continue to see high mortality throughout the month, since deaths lag behind the rise in infections.
Here’s what you need to know about the crisis in India.
How did it get so bad?
Infections began creeping upward in early March, but accelerated rapidly – the number of daily cases by the end of the month had jumped six times higher than at the start of the month.
That exponential rise has continued into May.
The second wave hit so much harder because people were unprepared, experts say.
The first wave peaked in September, and daily cases declined steadily in the following months; the apparent recovery seemed so successful that the country’s health minister declared in early March they were “in the endgame” of the pandemic.
And the country’s vaccination drive, among the world’s largest and most ambitious, got underway in January.
Residents relaxed Covid-safe practices like social distancing, and authorities were looser in their enforcement.
Although some states stayed cautious and made preparations for a second wave, none of it was enough – and nobody foresaw the massive coming wave.
“No one saw the extent of the surge,” said K. VijayRaghavan, principal scientific adviser for the Indian government.
“As the previous wave came down, there was in all of us a feeling that this was something which had been dealt with substantially.
We saw signs of a next surge, but the scale and the intensity of it was not clear.”
The crisis was made worse by a slow response from the central government.
Though some state ministers and local authorities began taking action since February, there appears to have been a vacuum of leadership within the central government, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi staying largely silent on the situation until recent weeks.
Modi finally broke his silence on April 20, acknowledging the urgency of the situation in an address to the nation, and launched a number of emergency measures to relieve the burden on states and hospitals.
But by then, some critics say, the damage was done.
And the real impact could be much worse than official figures suggest, experts say, citing a serious underreporting issue.
Only about 34% of deaths are happening in hospitals and facilities, said Dr. Hemant D. Shewade, a doctor specializing in community medicine – meaning many fatalities that occur at home or elsewhere may be missed in the official count.
“Our case detection rate is around 3.6%,” he added.
“I can safely say that our estimated Covid deaths are five times (the reported figure).”
Where is it happening?
New Delhi, the national capital, was badly hit by the second wave.
The union territory of Delhi, where New Delhi is located, was placed under lockdown on April 19, a move which has since been extended several times.
Hospitals across Delhi are reporting fatal oxygen shortages.
Eight people, including a doctor, died at a New Delhi hospital after the facility ran out of oxygen on May 1.
The same problem saw 20 critically ill patients die at another hospital on April 23.
The western state of Maharashtra has been worst affected, with a number of restrictions in place including weekend lockdowns.
Public gatherings have been capped at four people, while public transit across districts and within cities has been limited to essential services and “unavoidable events” like funerals.
The restrictions have been extended several times, and are in place until May 15.
As of May 11, at least 24 of India’s 36 states and union territories are under some form of Covid restrictions, according to CNN data compiled from state governments.
Apart from Delhi, a number of states and territories have imposed local lockdowns, including Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, and Kerala.
Who’s being affected?
Current Covid patients span nearly every age group, including young people, experts say.
“The virus and its second wave is hitting the younger people, and even children, in a way it had not in its first wave,” said Barkha Dutt, an author and journalist based in New Delhi.
“We’ve met 18-day-old babies that are fighting for their lives inside ICUs.”
However, government statistics show that proportionally, young people are not being affected more during the second wave than the first wave.
In both waves, young people make up a similar percentage of all patients – the apparent rise in young patients could be because the overall case figures are so much higher this time around.
Part of it could also have to do with India being a young country, said Dr. Lancelot Pinto, a consultant pulmonologist at P.D. Hinduja Hospital in Mumbai.
The median age of the population is 27, which means that when there’s a virus affecting the whole country at such a high speed, “there are bound to be a lot of young people coming to the hospital.”
The highest mortality, however, is still seen among patients age 70 and above, said Babu of the Public Health Foundation of India – “which means that we need to be protecting the elderly by providing critical care.”
What about the variants?
Scientists are still studying a coronavirus variant first identified in India called B.1.617, to gauge what effect, if any, the mutation has.
The World Health Organization has classified it as a variant of concern, saying on May 10 that it shows a possibility of increased transmissibility.
India’s National Center for Disease Control (NCDC), as well as top epidemiological experts in the country, have previously said that the surge in cases in some states showed a correlation with the rise in the variant.
Some of the country’s top epidemiological experts have also suggested there may be a correlation.
“In Maharashtra we saw (the Indian variant) go up, we saw an outbreak.
We are seeing it go up in Delhi, we are seeing an outbreak,” said Anurag Agrawal, director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, at a webinar in April.
Crowded areas in hard-hit cities that saw nearly 50% antibody levels during the first wave were still reporting positivity rates of more than 25%, Babu said in April.
“Clearly, it means that any protection against the earlier variant is not really useful because of the newer variant spreading faster.”
However, both the WHO and the NCDC have cautioned that further research is needed, as there is not enough data or genomic surveillance to determine whether the variant is driving the surge in cases.
“We have not been able to establish the epidemiological and clinical correlation completely yet,” NCDC Director Sujeet Singh said on May 5.
“This correlation is the main aspect, and without it we cannot link a particular surge to the variant.”
To assess the amount of variant activity occurring in a country, experts believe that between 5% and 10% of all Covid-19 test samples need to be genetically sequenced.
India has sequenced less than 1% of cases, according to Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health – meaning until we have more data available, it’s too soon to say what role the variant is playing.
“We need much more information about this virus variant in this lineage and all of the sub-lineages,” Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO Covid-19 technical lead, said on May 10.
“We need more targeted sequencing to be done, and to be shared in India and elsewhere, so that we know how much of this virus is circulating.”
What’s happening with vaccines?
India is administering two vaccines domestically: the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, known as Covishield in India, and its homegrown Covaxin, developed jointly by Bharat Biotech and the government-run Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).
In mid-April, India also approved Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine.
The country started its vaccination program in January for health care workers and priority groups – and marked its 100th day on April 25 – with the goal of fully inoculating 300 million people by August.
But the program had a sluggish start, facing logistical issues as well as vaccine hesitancy among the population, especially towards Covaxin, which was approved for emergency use before the efficacy data of its third phase trial were released.
As of May 11, India had administered more than 168 million doses of vaccines, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
More than 34 million people are fully vaccinated – about 2.52% of the country’s population.
However, India ranks lower than many countries in per capita vaccination, according to CNN data.
Earlier in April, the central government said it would fast-track emergency approvals for vaccines already approved by the World Health Organization or authorities in the US, Europe, Britain and Japan.
Companies still need to apply for approval in India, but they will be exempt from having to conduct local safety trials, expediting the process.
Starting May 1, all residents over the age of 18 are eligible for vaccination.
Private vaccination providers will also be able to sell and administer vaccines.
But state ministers criticized the new measures, pointing out there simply aren’t enough vaccines even if more people become eligible.
The chief minister of West Bengal called the decision “hollow, without substance and a regrettable show of evasion of responsibility by the central government at a time of crisis,” adding it could lead to “unscrupulous mechanisms” regarding pricing in the market.
A number of states had to delay their expanded May 1 rollout by anywhere between several days to several months, warning they had no shots to give.
What is the government doing?
The central government leaped into action in late April as the extent of the crisis became clear.
Modi’s administration scrambled to deliver more oxygen supplies to states, suspending all oxygen use for industrial purposes to free up stocks for medical use – while other supplies come from international aid.
The government said it is also setting up hundreds of oxygen generation plants, and is using railways and the military to quickly distribute oxygen tankers.
The administration began working in April to increase the number of hospital beds, and to build dedicated Covid hospitals in some cities, Modi said.
He has also refused to impose a national lockdown, and urged states to avoid doing so as well, calling such measures the “last option.”
Instead, he has advocated for “micro containment zones” where restrictions are focused on areas of concern.
It has been up to states to decide when and how to implement them.
The government has come under fire for its comments, including the health minister saying in April that they had provided Delhi with more oxygen “than they had asked for,” and characterizing the situation as under control.

The government has also faced criticism for its slow action – and for cracking down on major social media platforms in an attempt to stifle dissent.
In April, Twitter removed several tweets about Covid-19 at the request of the Indian government, including some that were critical of the Prime Minister’s handling of the pandemic.
Some of the tweets were posted by opposition politicians, who blamed Modi for the devastation.
The users had created “panic” by “using unrelated, old and out of the context images or visuals, communally sensitive posts and misinformation about Covid-19 protocols,” said India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology in a statement – prompting anger among the public, with many criticizing the government for focusing on its own image instead of the crisis.
In a statement on May 2, the Supreme Court ordered the central and state governments to take further action, including clamping down on price gouging of Covid medicines in the informal market.
It also warned that any information crackdown on social media could “attract a coercive exercise of jurisdiction” by the court.
How has the world responded?
Countries around the world have imposed travel bans, prohibiting flights to and from India.
Many nations have also offered critical aid, including Belgium, Uzbekistan, Germany, France, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates.
Private corporations and technology giants, including Google and Microsoft, have also pledged donations and aid.
The Biden administration and the US Defense Department will deploy supplies and support to India, including sending ventilators, PPE, rapid diagnostic test kits, and therapeutics, according to the White House and senior officials.
The US has a temporary ban in place on exporting raw materials critical for vaccine production – but the White House announced it would partially lift it by identifying “specific raw material urgently required for Indian manufacture of the Covishield vaccine that will immediately be made available for India.”
In April, the White House said it could share up to 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine – which the US currently has stockpiled – with other countries in the coming months, assuming the US Food and Drug Administration issues an emergency use authorization for that vaccine.
Biden has said it was his “intention” to send actual vaccines to India, but did not specify any details on when or how that will be carried out.
Multiple world leaders have pressed Biden to share doses as other countries have struggled to ramp up vaccinations.
The United Kingdom has sent more than 1,700 pieces of medical equipment to India, including oxygen concentrators and ventilators.
The aid follows a direct request by Modi to the UK.
Neighboring Pakistan, which has a long and hostile history with India, announced it would provide “relief support” including ventilators, PPE and other medical assistance.
“I want to express our solidarity with the people of India as they battle a dangerous wave of Covid-19,” said Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan in an April statement.
“Our prayers for a speedy recovery go to all those suffering from the pandemic,” said Khan.
“We must fight this global challenge confronting humanity together.”
CNN —
New York state reported that Thursday had the highest single day count of new Covid-19 cases with 21,027, according to data released Friday.
New York’s data also revealed that positive Covid-19 cases in the state jumped 154% in less than a week.
The previous high was January 14 when there were 19,942 new cases reported.
“We must not make light of the winter surge that we are facing, and we should continue to encourage everyone we know to get vaccinated, get the booster and wear a mask,” Gov. Kathy Hochul said Thursday in a news release.
Covid-19-related hospitalizations remain comparatively low.
On Friday, the state reported 3,839 hospitalizations, as compared with 8,088 on January 14, according to state data.
At its peak in mid-April 2020, New York’s hospitalization total for Covid-19 nearly reached 19,000.
The data revelations come as New York City reported its positivity rate from PCR tests doubled over a four-day period.
The NYC Health Commissioner says cases have tripled in the past month.
More data needed on severity of Omicron, top health official says
The US will see many cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus, but it’s too soon to assume it will cause milder disease, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins said Friday.
“It’s clear that Omicron is an extremely contagious variant, that it doubles every two to four days,” Collins told CNN’s Anderson Cooper.
Collins said people can limit the consequences of the variant with vaccines and especially with boosters.
Data from two weeks of South African cases appeared to indicate Omicron was milder in severity.
The CDC said last week that it looked at 43 cases and most of those people had mild symptoms.
Most were vaccinated and about a third of the total group had received a booster shot.
UK epidemiologists said this week they found no evidence that Omicron is causing milder disease there, but the Imperial College London team also said there was not much data to go on yet.
“We still don’t really know – and there’s some controversy about this – whether Omicron causes the same kind of severity of disease or whether it’s a somewhat milder form of the illness,” Collins said.
“We really need to know that.
I would not assume right now that it is milder, but wouldn’t that be nice if it turned out to be the case?”
he asked.
With a more infectious variant, even if it’s milder, it could still send more people to hospitals.
“The problem, of course, is if this is so infectious – and we might see hundreds of thousands of cases every day, maybe even a million cases in a day from Omicron – even if it’s a little less severe, you are going to have a lot of people in the hospital and our hospitals are already really stretched with Delta, especially in the northern part of the country,” Collins said.
CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Friday the Omicron coronavirus variant is “increasing rapidly” and expected “to become the dominant strain in the United States, as it has in other countries, in the coming weeks.”
Andy Slavitt, a former senior pandemic adviser to President Joe Biden, said that while tools such as vaccines are now widely available rather than during last winter’s surge, “a very rough January” lies ahead due to Omicron.
“For the health care workers, the hospitals, for people who are sick, even sick with things other than Covid, that represents a real danger and a real threat,” Slavitt told CNN’s Don Lemon on Thursday.
Two indicators are up about 40% in the last month, according to data from Johns Hopkins University: the seven-day average of new cases topped 120,000; and the total number of hospitalizations stands at more than 68,000.
The seven-day average for deaths was 1,286 as of Thursday, an 8% increase from a month ago, the data show.
Getting vaccinated or boosted remains key as millions of Americans get ready for holiday travel.
Recent lab studies of blood taken from vaccinated people and exposed to Omicron showed the variant can evade some protection offered by two doses of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine, but a booster dose restores much of that immunity, researchers reported Wednesday.
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has shown similar results.
On Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its recommendations for Covid-19 vaccines to make clear that shots made by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech are preferred over Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine.
This means people who got the J&J vaccine should be looking to get a booster shot, but one made by another company, Collins told CNN.
“They should get a booster from an mRNA vaccine,” Collins said.
“NIH did this study of mix and match in terms of what was your initial vaccine and what did you get boosted with?
If you start with J&J and get an mRNA booster, you get a pretty good result from that.
“I watch that closely.
I have two grandchildren who got J&J.
They are now boosted, and I think they are going to be fine.”
The daily rate of vaccinations is up around 22% from a month prior, according to CDC data, with more than half being booster doses.
At the current pace, it will take more than two months for at least half of adults to get a Covid-19 booster, according to a CNN analysis of CDC data.
Biden said Thursday that vaccinations and boosters are essential to keeping businesses and holiday gatherings safe.
“For the unvaccinated, we are looking at a winter of severe illness and death,” he said.
“But there’s good news if you’re vaccinated and you have your booster shot, you’re protected from severe illness and death.”

Vaccines still the best way to fight Covid-19, officials say
Even with the potential spread of the Omicron variant, former Obama White House health policy adviser Dr. Zeke Emanuel said the United States has tools to fight Covid-19, unlike during its onset.
“In March 2020, we didn’t understand a lot about coronavirus.
Second of all, we have vaccines now.
We have the ability to change those vaccines.
We’re getting oral therapeutics.
We have much better tests and test availability.
None of that’s perfect, but it’s much better than it was in March 2020,” Emanuel told CNN’s Michael Smerconish on Thursday.
Continued research into additional drugs to fight coronavirus is ongoing.
Merck’s Covid-19 antiviral, molnupiravir, lowers the risk of hospitalization or death in high-risk unvaccinated adults by 30%, according to a statement issued after publication of its clinical trial data in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Among people who got the treatment, the risk of hospitalization and death was 6.8%, compared with 9.7% among people who got a placebo, the study said.
There was one death in the treatment group, compared with nine deaths in the placebo group.
We are at war, Fauci says
The US can win the war against the coronavirus if people keep fighting and use the weapons at hand, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Friday.
Fauci likened the fight against Covid-19 to World War II, which raged for years.
“We will win this war with this virus, but we will win it only because we apply the things that we have: the interventions,” said Fauci, longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
“We are so fortunate that we have a highly effective and safe vaccine.
We know what public health mitigations work.
We have just got to hang in there.
We can’t give up.”
Fauci said Americans should be fine for the upcoming holidays if people follow the recommendations of the CDC on vaccinations and mask wearing.
And Collins said people should avoid tight, indoor spaces and should consider not being around the unvaccinated.
“This is, after all, a very wily virus
but it still has the same way of being transmitted by people being close together in a close space,” he said.
CDC director: Test-to-stay works
Walensky said Friday that new evidence shows that “test-to-stay,” which involves testing instead of quarantining students who may have been exposed to the virus at school, works to keep children in school safely, even if they have been exposed to the coronavirus.
“Test-to-stay is an encouraging public health practice to keep our children in school,” Walensky said during a virtual White House briefing.
In the past few months, the CDC has collaborated with certain school districts to evaluate test-to-stay programs.
Two of the communities that collaborated with the CDC are Lake County, Illinois, and Los Angeles County, California.
Pfizer to add third dose to children’s vaccine trials
Pfizer said Friday that interim data indicated the child-sized doses of its vaccine weren’t producing the expected immunity in the 2- to 5-year-old group.
The company said it was adding a third dose, given two months after the second dose, to the clinical trials regimen for those children.
The company said it expected to apply for US Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization in the second quarter of 2022 (instead of first quarter).
Fauci said the delay in authorization in necessary.
“You want to really get the right dose and the right regimen for the children,” he told CNN.
“So although you don’t like there to be a delay, you want to get it right, and that’s what they’re talking about. “
Patient population
The institutional review board of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People’s Hospital approved this retrospective study with a waiver of informed consent.
All methods in the current study was carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.
From February 10th, 2020 to April 9th, 2020, hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection (diagnosed by RT-PCR assay with throat swab) were retrospectively included.
The RT-PCR tests were performed by using TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR Kits from Shanghai Huirui Biotechnology Co., Ltd.
The diagnosis was made if any of the RT-PCR result was positive when multiple tests were performed.
The exclusion criteria were: (1) the image quality of chest CT was significantly impaired so that AI based quantification was not feasible; (2) patients had superimposed infection of other pathogens; (3) patients were initially classified as severe or critical type on admission.
The initial CT scan on admission was used for further analysis.
Chest CT protocol
All patients were scanned with a 128-slice multi-detector CT (Revolution Maxima, GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, US) in supine position with inspiratory breath hold.
The main acquisition parameters were listed as follow: tube voltage = 120 kVp, tube current was automatically modulated (150 mA–350 mA), slice thickness = 1.25 mm, slice interval = 1 mm, matrix = 512 * 512, field of view = 350 mm * 350 mm.
Two datasets with different kernels were reconstructed for the image interpretation of lung (sharp kernel, Lung, GE Medical Systems) and mediastinum (smooth kernel, Stnd, GE Medical Systems).
Visual analysis of chest
CT
All datasets were reconstructed with lung kernel and soft kernel for evaluation of pulmonary parenchyma and mediastinum.
Lung window was set as a level of − 600HU and width of 1200HU whereas mediastinal window was set a level of 40HU and width of 350HU.
The presence of following lesions were visually assessed: (1) ground glass opacity (GGO), which was defined as hazy increased attenuation with preserved margins of bronchus and vasculature11; (2) consolidation, which was defined as opacification with obscured margins of bronchus and vasculature; (3) reticulation; (4) nodules; (5) lymphadenopathy; (6) pleural effusion; (7) other abnormalities.
For semi-quantitative analysis, one previously reported CT score system was employed12.
In brief, each lung was divided into three zones: upper (above the carina), middle (between carina and inferior pulmonary vein), and lower (below the inferior pulmonary vein) zones.
Each lung zone was assigned a score that was based on the extent of involvement: score 0, 0% involvement; score 1, < 25% involvement; score 2, 25–50% involvement; score 3, 50–75% involvement; and score 4, ≥ 75% involvement.
The summed score on per-patient level indicated overall lung involvement (maximal CT score for both lungs was 24)12.
Two chest radiologists (with 6-year and 14-year experience of chest imaging) independently evaluated all patients without the knowing of clinical characteristics and prognosis.
Any disagreement between two observers was resolved by consensus.
AI assisted lesion quantification
Lesion quantification was performed using a commercially available software (LungDoc, version 1.19.1, ShuKun Network Technology, Beijing, China).
In the recognition of pneumonia regions, the semantic segmentation technology based on deep learning was used to perform one-time segmentation extraction of the pneumonia regions in the input lung parenchyma.
The network used a deep convolutional neural network based on residual structure UNet, of which details were given in online supplemental materials.
The volumes of GGO and consolidation were automatically measured according to different attenuation thresholds (− 750HU ~
− 300HU for GGO, − 300HU ~
50HU for consolidation)13.
The percentages of GGO volume as well as consolidation volume versus whole lung volume were also recorded.
Two chest radiologists (with 6-year and 14-year experience of chest imaging) independently supervised the lesion quantification and manual adjustment of lesion regions was made when necessary.
Any disagreement between two observers was resolved by consensus.
Disease severity and clinical outcome
Disease severity was evaluated according to the 6th edition of diagnosis and treatment protocols of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus, issued by Chinese centers for disease control and prevention14.
Patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were classified into four types as described below: (1) mild, patients with mild symptoms and no imaging finding of pneumonia; (2) moderate, patients with fever, respiratory symptoms and imaging findings of pneumonia; (3) severe, patients met any of the following conditions (a. respiratory distress, respiratory rate ≥ 30 times/min; b. SpO 2 < 93% at rest; c. PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300 mmHg; d. rapid progression of disease involvement [more than 50%] on chest CT within 24 ~ 48 h ); (4) critical, patients met any of the following conditions (a. respiratory failure and need mechanical assistance; b. shock; c. “extra pulmonary” organ failure, d. intensive care unit
[ICU] is needed).
For further analysis, patients were grouped as “non-severe” (classified as mild or moderate type) and “progress-to-severe” (classified as severe or critical type) according to the most severe classification during hospitalization.
In addition, the mortality rate and rate of critical conditions (a. respiratory failure and need mechanical assistance; b. shock; c. “extra pulmonary” organ failure, d. ICU stay) were also recorded.
Patients were considered event-free if they survived without occurrence of the above critical conditions.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with a commercially available statistical software (MedCalc Statistical Software version 15.2.2, MedCalc Software BVBA, Ostend, Belgium).
Quantitative variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
Student’s t test was used for normally distributed data, and the Mann–Whitney U test for non-normally distributed data.
Categorical variables were reported as count (%), and compared by the Fisher exact test or chi-square test.
Interobserver agreement of CT semi-quantitative score and AI assisted quantification was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).
The Dice coefficient was used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning algorithms.
Logistic regression model was used to calculate the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for different CT parameters.
ROC analysis was performed by the method developed by Hanley and McNeil15.
The area under curve (AUC) of each parameter was calculated and the optimal cutoff values for all parameters were determined by the Youden index, the maximum sum of sensitivity and specificity.
To ascertain the associations of CT-derived semi-quantitative and quantitative parameters with disease severity progression and clinical outcome, we performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, which was performed by using the “stepwise” approach.
The model included variables with p < 0.20 in the univariate analysis.
A two-tailed P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
COVID-19 Booster Shots Will Roll Out In September
In The U.S.
Enlarge this image toggle caption Mary Altaffer/AP Mary Altaffer/AP
COVID-19 booster shots of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are set to become available for all U.S. adults beginning next month, the country's top health officials announced Wednesday.
"We know that even highly effective vaccines become less effective over time," Dr. Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general, said at a White House briefing.
"It is now our clinical judgment that the time to lay out a plan for COVID boosters is now.
"
He added, "This includes our most vulnerable populations, like our health care providers, nursing home residents and other seniors.
We will also begin delivering booster shots directly to residents of long-term care facilities.
"
People who received the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will be eligible before Johnson & Johnson recipients
People 18 years and older who received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines will be eligible for a booster dose eight months after their second dose, officials said.
The booster plan would go into effect starting the week of Sept. 20.
People who got the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine would also likely need an additional shot to prolong its effectiveness against coronavirus infection and to reduce the severity of COVID-19 symptoms, health officials said.
However, they are still conducting research and not yet releasing plans for booster shots for people who received that type of vaccine.
The data shows vaccines become less effective over time
The announcement comes as health officials across the country are battling a new wave of COVID-19 cases linked to the highly transmissible delta variant.
The latest infections have once again pushed intensive care unit occupancy rates to the breaking point in multiple states, especially those with low rates of vaccination.
The surgeon general said that health officials were concerned about "waning immunity and the strength of the delta variant" — a "pattern of decline" that could "continue in the coming months.
"
In a statement released shortly before Wednesday's briefing, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services cautioned that "the current protection against severe disease, hospitalization, and death could diminish in the months ahead, especially among those who are at higher risk or were vaccinated during the earlier phases of the vaccination rollout.
"
Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cited three new studies in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report that show reduction in protection from infection over time, including in nursing homes and against the delta variant.
Effectiveness against severe disease, hospitalization and death remains relatively high, she said.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the chief medical adviser to President Biden, said the plan for a booster is happening now because "if you wait for something bad to happen, you're considerably behind in your response."
When it comes to the virus, he said, it's better to stay ahead of it than chase after it.
The White House says it's trying to make it easy for people to get the shots
Jeffrey Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said the aim was to make the administration of booster shots as easy as possible — and that they would be given at the same locations where people received their first and second vaccine doses.
He said 90% of Americans lived within 5 miles of one of the more than 80,000 vaccination sites across the country.
He also defended the plan to give Americans an additional dose while much of the rest of the world remained unvaccinated.
The U.S. goal is to administer 100 million booster shots in the coming months.
Over the same time period, 200 million doses would be donated to other countries, Zients said.
Biden addressed this issue himself, when he delivered remarks later Wednesday.
"We can take care of America and help the world at the same time," he said.
Biden also outlined plans to require nursing homes to vaccinate staff or risk losing Medicare and Medicaid funding.
"With this announcement," he said, "I'm using the power of the federal government, as a payer of health care costs, to ensure we reduce those risks to our most vulnerable seniors.
"
The Department of Health and Human Services is drafting the regulation to go into effect next month.
Since the start of the pandemic some 20 months ago, more than 623,000 people in the U.S. have died from COVID-19, according to figures tallied by Johns Hopkins University.
At Wednesday's briefing, the CDC's Walensky said the U.S. was averaging about 500 COVID-19 deaths per day.
TechnipFMC Ghana has donated vital PPE and sanitary supplies to a hospital suffering shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Face masks, disposable gowns, gloves and hand sanitizers were handed over to the Ga East Municipal Hospital in the capital Accra, where TechnipFMC has a facility.
The pandemic was at its worst in Ghana earlier this year and supplies of the vital equipment were running low.
The company, which is committed to making a positive impact in the places where it operates, stepped in to help.
The head of administration at the hospital, Rev Samuel Obeng-Mensah, thanked the company for the donation, saying it come at a time of need.
The supplies were handed over by Dr Joseph Dankwah, Business Development Manager; Shaun Watson, Country Manager; Abigail Mensah, Communication and Sustainability Manager; and Michael Kuma, Managing Director.
Dr Dankwah said, “While front-line workers are doing their jobs, they are risking their lives and those of their families.
Providing the hospital with PPE is TechnipFMC’s contribution to ensure that doctors and nurses work in a safer environment to provide quality health care and save lives.”
Sustainability is one of the TechnipFMC’s foundational beliefs and the company recently its Environmental, Social and Governance commitments.
India Likely Had 6.4 Million Covid Cases By May, Says ICMR's Sero Survey
Children are always going to find cunning ways to bunk off school, and the latest trick is to fake a positive COVID-19 lateral flow test (LFT) using soft drinks.
So how are fruit juices, cola and devious kids fooling the tests and is there a way to tell a fake positive result from a real one?
I’ve tried to find out.
First, I thought it best to check the claims, so I cracked open bottles of cola and orange juice, then deposited a few drops directly onto LFTs.
Sure enough, a few minutes later, two lines appeared on each test, supposedly indicating the presence of the virus that causes COVID-19.
It’s worth understanding how the tests work.
If you open up an LFT device, you’ll find a strip of paper-like material, called nitrocellulose, and a small red pad, hidden under the plastic casing below the T-line.
Absorbed to the red pad are antibodies that bind to the COVID-19 virus.
They are also attached to gold nanoparticles (tiny particles of gold actually appear red), which allow us to see where the antibodies are on the device.
When you do a test, you mix your sample with a liquid buffer solution, ensuring the sample stays at an optimum pH, before dripping it on the strip.
Mark Lorch , Author provided
The fluid wicks up the nitrocellulose strip and picks up the gold and antibodies.
The latter also bind to the virus, if present.
Further up the strip, next to the T (for test), are more antibodies that bind the virus.
But these antibodies are not free to move – they are stuck to the nitrocellulose.
As the red smear of gold-labelled antibodies pass this second set of antibodies, these also grab hold of the virus.
The virus is then bound to both sets of antibodies – leaving everything, including the gold, immobilised on a line next to the T on the device, indicating a positive test.
Gold antibodies that haven’t bound to the virus carry on up the strip where they meet a third set of antibodies, not designed to pick up COVID-19, stuck at the C (for control) line.
These trap the remaining gold particles, without having to do so via the virus.
This final line is used to indicate the test has worked.
Acid test
So how can a soft drink cause the appearance of a red T line?
One possibility is that the drinks contain something that the antibodies recognise and bind to, just as they do to the virus.
But this is rather unlikely.
The reason antibodies are used in tests like these is that they are incredibly fussy about what they bind to.
There’s all sorts of stuff in the snot and saliva collected by the swabs you take from the nose and mouth, and the antibodies totally ignore this mess of protein, other viruses and remains of your breakfast.
So they aren’t going to react to the ingredients of a soft drink.
A much more likely explanation is that something in the drinks is affecting the function of the antibodies.
A range of fluids, from fruit juice to cola, have been used to fool the tests, but they all have one thing in common – they are highly acidic.
The citric acid in orange juice, phosphoric acid in cola and malic acid in apple juice give these beverages a pH between 2.5 and 4.
These are pretty harsh conditions for antibodies, which have evolved to work largely within the bloodstream, with its almost neutral pH of about 7.4.
Maintaining an ideal pH for the antibodies is key to the correct function of the test, and that’s the job of the liquid buffer solution that you mix your sample with, provided with the test.
The critical role of the buffer is highlighted by the fact that if you mix cola with the buffer – as shown in this debunking of an Austrian politician’s claim that mass testing is worthless – then the LFTs behave exactly as you’d expect: negative for COVID-19.
So without the buffer, the antibodies in the test are fully exposed to the acidic pH of the beverages.
And this has a dramatic effect on their structure and function.
Antibodies are proteins, which are comprised of amino acid building blocks, attached together to form long, linear chains.
These chains fold up into very specific structures.
Even a small change to the chains can dramatically impact a protein’s function.
These structures are maintained by a network of many thousands of interactions between the various parts of the protein.
For example, negatively charged parts of a protein will be attracted to positively charged areas.
But in acidic conditions, the protein becomes increasingly positively charged.
As a result, many of the interactions that hold the protein together are disrupted, the delicate structure of the protein is affected and it no longer functions correctly.
In this case, the antibodies’ sensitivity to the virus is lost.
Given this, you might expect that the acidic drinks would result in completely blank tests.
But denatured proteins are sticky beasts.
All of those perfectly evolved interactions that would normally hold the protein together are now orphaned and looking for something to bind to.
So a likely explanation is that the immobilised antibodies at the T-line stick directly to the gold particles as they pass by, producing the notorious cola-induced false positive result.
Is there then a way to spot a fake positive test?
The antibodies (like most proteins) are capable of refolding and regaining their function when they are returned to more favourable conditions.
So I tried washing a test that had been dripped with cola with buffer solution, and sure enough the immobilised antibodies at the T-line regained normal function and released the gold particles, revealing the true negative result on the test.

CNN —
As the coronavirus surges again in the United States, scientists have found another disaster is playing a key role in the number of people who contract severe Covid-19 cases and how many die: wildfires.
A new study published in the journal Science Advances found that increases in fine particulate matter from wildfire smoke in 2020 led to a surge in Covid-19 cases and deaths in California, Oregon and Washington.
“Fine particulate matter air pollution can be an additional vehicle for spreading the virus even faster,” Francesca Dominici, co-author of the study and professor of biostatistics, population and data science at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told CNN.
“Considering that we are seeing an increased risk of cases from the Delta
[variant]
and we already have the wildfires, that’s going to be concerning.”
Fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5, is among tiniest yet also the most dangerous pollutants.
When inhaled, it travels deep into lung tissue where it can enter the bloodstream.
PM2.5, which comes from other sources like fossil fuel plants, cars and agriculture, and is linked to a number of health complications: asthma, heart disease, chronic bronchitis, and other respiratory illnesses — all underlying conditions that make people vulnerable to severe outcomes from Covid-19.
Dr. Albert Rizzo, chief medical officer at the American Lung Association, who was not involved in the new study, said that air pollution from wildfire smoke is likely causing inflammation in the lungs.
“The particulate matter is what leads the airways to be a very fertile ground for uninvited infection like the Covid virus to get into our airway,” Rizzo told CNN.
“The immune system is only geared up to try to fight the effects of a particulate matter and now it has a virus that it has to trigger against as well.”
It’s a dangerous combination, Dominici said.
“Right now, considering that we are seeing an increase in risks and cases due to the Delta variant, and we’re already getting wildfires, that’s going to be concerning,” she added.
2020 was a historic wildfire season, scorching more than 10 million acres across the Western states.
While the direct death toll from the fires was at least 43, researchers at Stanford University in September estimated roughly 1,200 to 3,000 excess deaths in California from inhaling wildfire smoke, or PM 2.5.
The effects of the 2021 Western wildfires have become so far-reaching that not only did the smoke drift and became visible across the country as far as New York, but the fires have been exhibiting extreme fire behavior, such as rotational patterns within the fire, or producing rare, towering clouds.

The Harvard study looked at 92 counties in California, Oregon, and Washington impacted by wildfire in 2020.
Using satellite images for the fires and public data on Covid-19 cases and deaths in the three Western states, researchers found that in the majority of the counties they studied, there was strong evidence that the more smoke and soot there was, the more there were cases and deaths from Covid.
If PM 2.5 levels stayed higher for 28 days in a row, cases rose by nearly 12% and deaths by more than 8%.
“This is a very important study,” Donghai Liang, professor of environmental health at Emory University, who was not involved in the study, told CNN.
“This is among those first studies that really report the link between particulate matter coming out of the 2020 wildfires in the United States and how they contribute to the exacerbation on Covid-19 cases and deaths.”
As the climate crisis accelerates, Liang said public health risks associated with wildfires may worsen.
According to the landmark UN report published Monday, climate change-fueled drought and heat now make wildfire seasons longer and result in more destructive fires.
“Even without Covid, we’ve been concerned that climate change that leads to hotter environments, and droughts, is fodder for wildfires to occur,” Rizzo said “Then you add the wildfire ash and soot to the air quality, it does make respiratory issues much more likely to occur.”
Tarik Benmarhnia, a climate change epidemiologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, told CNN the “repeat nature” of more-frequent wildfires could exacerbate long-term public health impacts.
Several studies have shown that short-term PM 2.5 exposure from wildfire smoke has led to increase in emergency department visits and hospitalizations.
“When you have a [wildfire] episode, we will see a huge increase in hospitalization for respiratory conditions or cardiovascular conditions – and that’s mostly the smoke, which is constituted mostly by PM 2.5,” Benmarhnia said.
Certain communities are also at higher risk from exposure to wildfire smoke, including people with heart or lung disease, the elderly, the houseless, children and babies.
In a separate study published in April, Benmarhnia and his colleagues found that wildfire smoke is sending children ages 19 and younger to emergency rooms with respiratory problems at higher rates than ever before.
“Kids inhale way more air than us, and their respiratory system is still being developed,” he said.
“So they’re way more vulnerable than adults and it could be a very dangerous situation.”

It’s not just the toxicity of wildfire smoke, but also what the fire burns.
Once the fire reaches a community and chars houses, it burns materials such as plastic that contain hazardous chemicals.
But unlike the smoke, Benmarhnia said, the toxic emissions are not transported as far away, making it a problem for local communities.
As wildfires intensify, Dominici says she hopes that the study will push more people to act on environmental justice for communities most impacted and also the climate crisis at large.
“I hope that by showing how catastrophic the combination of wildfires and Covid-19 is, this will be an additional piece of evidence for increasing the emergency of combating climate change,” Dominici said.
Officials, who set June 1 as the target date for reopening earlier in May, appear ready to accelerate what has been a gradual easing in recent days.
A few malls and markets have reopened, and some residents have been given passes allowing them out for a few hours at a time.
In at least some chat groups, cynicism about the slow pace and stop-and-go nature of opening up gave way Tuesday to excitement about the prospect of being able to move about freely in the city for the first time since the end of March.
John Manza, Assistant Secretary General for Operations, outlines NATO’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
From the beginning, NATO has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic: we have flown medical personnel, transported medical supplies and equipment, helped build field hospitals, engaged our scientific community, created a stockpile of supplies and established a trust fund.
All the while, our operations and missions have continued and our ability to deter and defend remains intact.
Questions and Answers with John Manza, Assistant Secretary General for Operations
1.
Why did NATO get involved in the wider response to the COVID-19 pandemic?
Managing the effects of pandemics is fundamentally the job of national governments.
But Allies look out for each other and were able to respond when help was requested.
It's important to note that pandemics can have consequences for the security of the Alliance, so we want to remain fully engaged to support Allies and partners within our means and capabilities.
Allies and partners need to know that NATO stands with them in solidarity and that we are ready to support when they are faced with such emergencies.
2.
Throughout the pandemic, how was NATO able to ensure its missions and operations could continue?
Throughout the first wave of the pandemic, NATO's operational readiness and preparedness to deal with a wide range of security threats was never compromised.
NATO drew on its experience in crisis management and disaster relief to both adapt to the crisis and to sustain our operations.
We were in constant contact with our commanders, who were already taking steps to protect the force and to ensure that operations continued uninterrupted.
We operate in many places, from Afghanistan to Kosovo to Iraq and in the Mediterranean.
Given the challenges of that geography and the wide variety of operating environments, we were pleased with our agility overall
and we were proud of our commanders and forces for adapting so quickly and so well.
3.
What is NATO doing to prepare for the possibility of similar crises in the future?
In June 2020, NATO Defence Ministers decided on a new Operations Plan to ensure that the Alliance is ready to help Allies and partners.
This plan can be activated at any time during this crisis, for future pandemics or other large-scale medical emergencies.
NATO also established the Pandemic Response Trust Fund that maintains a stockpile of medical equipment and supplies to be able to provide immediate relief to Allies or partners in need.
The trust fund is very active and is performing well.
Establishing this trust fund has already enhanced our preparedness for similar pandemics in the future.
The modalities have been established and best practices have been adopted accordingly.
As part of a coordinated approach, NATO continues to work closely with other international organisations, including the European Union, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Health Organization and the United Nations World Food Programme.
These established connections have matured significantly over the past year and we are all in a better position to address similar crises in the future.

The three COVID-19 stimulus bills that Congress has passed provide additional funding for hospitals and for free coronavirus testing for the uninsured through Medicaid.
While Congress did not allocate any money specifically for COVID-19 treatment or coverage for the uninsured, President Trump has stated his intention to reimburse hospitals for treating the uninsured by tapping a new $100 billion in funding for hospitals and other health care entities included in the third stimulus, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
The legislation provided little detail about how funding would be distributed, giving significant discretion to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
To date, few specifics on the new policy for covering COVID-19 treatment costs of uninsured patients have been released, but administration officials have said that hospitals would get reimbursed at Medicare rates, which are substantially lower than prices paid by private insurers.
The administration has not provided any cost estimates for this new policy, other than to say that the funding will come from the $100 billion in the CARES Act.
How much of that funding will be used to pay for care for the uninsured is an important part of thinking through the implications of this policy.
In this brief, we estimate a range of costs for reimbursing hospitals for treatment of COVID-19 for the uninsured and discuss some outstanding questions about the Trump administration’s new policy.
Estimating the Cost of Hospital Care for COVID-19 for People Who are Uninsured
There is still a great deal of uncertainty surrounding how the COVID-19 epidemic will evolve, including how many people will become infected and how many will become severely ill and require hospitalization.
Therefore, we present a range of cost estimates for the Trump administration’s proposal to reimburse hospitals for COVID-19 treatments for uninsured patients, based on results from recent studies and models.
Our key assumptions include:
20% to 60% of people will ultimately become infected with the coronavirus, based on estimates from epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch at the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
15% of people who are infected will require hospitalization, similar to the assumption in a model of hospital use for COVID-19 developed by the Harvard Global Health Institute.
We reduce the hospitalization rate by 20% to 12% to reflect the fact that the uninsured are almost entirely under age 65 and, therefore, in many cases are at lower risk for severe illness from COVID-19, based on a model recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).
15% of all hospitalizations will require the most intensive care, including admission into an intensive care unit and use of a ventilator.
This is consistent with estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and model results from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.
We estimate that 2% to 7% of uninsured people will require hospitalization for COVID-19, ranging from about 670,000 to slightly more than 2 million hospital admissions.
This range is very similar to the results (weighted by the age distribution of the population) in the model published in the PNAS, which presents a range of hospitalization rates based on alternative assumptions about transmission of the virus and how many people isolate themselves after the onset of symptoms.
To project how much hospitals would get paid by the federal government for treating uninsured patients, we look at payments for admissions for similar conditions.
For less severe hospitalizations, we use the average Medicare payment for respiratory infections and inflammations with major comorbidities or complications in 2017, which was $13,297.
For more severe hospitalizations, we use the average Medicare payment for a respiratory system diagnosis with ventilator support for greater than 96 hours, which was $40,218.
Each of these average payments was then increased by 20% to account for the add-on to Medicare inpatient reimbursement for patients with COVID-19 that was included in the CARES Act.
Before accounting for the 20% add on, Medicare payments are about half of what private insurers pay on average for the same diagnoses.
In the absence of this new proposed policy, many of the uninsured would typically be billed based on hospital charges, which are the undiscounted “list prices” for care and are typically much higher than even private insurance reimbursement.
Based on the above, we estimate total payments to hospitals for treating uninsured patients under the Trump administration policy would range from $13.9 billion to $41.8 billion.
At the top end of the range, payments on behalf of the uninsured would consume more than 40% of the $100 billion fund Congress created to help hospitals and others respond to the COVID-19 epidemic.
Given the uncertainty of our estimates of the total funding that will be needed to reimburse hospitals, and the fact that infections may come in several waves over the next year, it is unclear whether the new fund will be able to cover the costs of the uninsured in addition to other needs, such as the purchase of medical supplies and the construction of temporary facilities.
Depending on how the remaining funds are allocated, this policy could lead to larger share of the $100 billion fund going to hospitals in states with higher uninsured rates that chose to not expand Medicaid.
This would leave less funding for hospitals in states with lower uninsured rates that did expand Medicaid and, in some cases, also instituted new open enrollment periods in state-based exchanges.
Under the Affordable Care Act, states have the option to expand Medicaid to adults without dependent children up to 138% of poverty, with the federal government paying 90% of the cost.
Caveats and Outstanding Questions
These estimates are highly uncertain, driven in particular by uncertainty surrounding how many people will become infected with the coronavirus.
There is still a lot unknown about how the epidemic will evolve, which will be affected by policies like social distancing and the extent to which they are followed by the public.
We will be able to refine the estimates as more data become available.
The estimates used to calculate the number of uninsured who are hospitalized are likely to be conservative, because they are based on a total of 27.9 million people uninsured from the most recent data in 2018.
That number has no doubt increased, particularly with millions of people recently losing their jobs and, in many cases, their employer-provided health insurance.
Many of the people who were previously uninsured, and many of those who have become recently unemployed, are eligible for Medicaid or premium subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.
Our calculations of the average cost of hospitalization also used several conservative assumptions regarding Medicare payments.
The average Medicare payment data that we used was from 2017 and was not updated for inflation or for Medicare payment updates since that time.
Additionally, we did not account for a likely difference in the geographic mix of COVID-19 patients as compared to those previously treated under those same Medicare codes in 2017.
A geographic mix of COVID-19 patients more heavily concentrated in high wager areas such as New York would increase the total cost of reimbursing for care for the uninsured.
This analysis also does not account for a temporary end to the 2% cut to Medicare that was part of sequestration and does not account for Medicare outlier payments, which provide additional reimbursement for “cases involving extraordinarily high costs.”
While the Trump administration policy will provide relief to uninsured patients who become severely ill from COVID-19, and the hospitals that treat them, how much relief will depend on a number of implementation details that are not yet clear.
For example, the administration statement refers to reimbursement of hospitals for care delivered to uninsured patients.
However, hospital-based physicians typically bill patients separately for the physician service component of their care, and uninsured patients may still be responsible for those bills.
Our analysis of private insurance claims shows that non-hospital charges for hospital admissions related to COVID-19 treatment are generally about 10% of the total bill and average several thousand dollars or more for patients who require a ventilator.
Our analysis does not take into account the likelihood that patients could also face substantial medical bills for outpatient care outside of hospitals, or the fact that this policy could encourage the uninsured to seek care in hospitals instead of lower-cost settings where the federal government will not be reimbursing for their care.
The uninsured will also not be covered for needed follow-up care if that care is not provided in a hospital.
In addition, the administration has not specified whether it will cover treatment costs for patients who seek care for symptoms that are typical of COVID-19 but ultimately test negative for the coronavirus.
Additionally, it is unclear if the uninsured will still be required to pay cost sharing for their hospital care, although Secretary Azar stated that hospitals receiving these funds will not be permitted to balance bill patients for the difference between Medicare reimbursement and the hospital’s charges.
There have been no changes to cost sharing in traditional Medicare, but most Medicare Advantage plans have said they will waive cost sharing for COVID-19 treatment, and all Medicare patients are protected against balance billing.
Privately insured patients are not protected from balance billing by providers or hospitals and they have no federal protection against cost sharing, although some insurers have said they will waive cost sharing for their fully insured plans.
Medicaid patients, in contrast, have no cost sharing for COVID-19 treatment.
Ultimately, while this policy will help uninsured patients and discourage them from delaying care if they develop COVID-19, it is not a substitution for comprehensive health insurance.
“Among those who had received 2 doses of [AstraZeneca], there was NO protective effect of vaccination against symptomatic disease with Omicron from 15 weeks after the second dose.”
Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease by period after dose 2 and the booster dose is shown in Figure 1 and Table 2 for those who received a primary course of the ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccines.
For both primary courses, the booster dose given was BNT162b2.
Apart from 2-9 weeks post dose 2 for BNT162b2, effectiveness was lower for Omicron compared to Delta post vaccination at all time interval investigated.
Among those who had received 2 doses of AstraZeneca’s ChAdOx1, there was no protective effect of vaccination against symptomatic disease with Omicron from 15 weeks after the second dose.
Among those who had received 2 doses of BNT162b2, vaccine effectiveness was 88.0% 2-9 weeks after dose 2, dropping to 48.5% at 10-14 weeks post dose 2 and dropping further to between 34 and 37% from 15 weeks post dose 2.
Among those who received ChAdOx1 as the primary course, from 2 weeks after a BNT162b2 booster dose, vaccine effectiveness increased to 71.4%.
Vaccine effectiveness increased to 75.5% after the booster among those who had received BNT162b2 as the primary course.
With the Delta variant, effectiveness drops from 76.2% 2-9 weeks after dose 2 down to 41.8% at 25+ weeks after dose 2 with a ChAdOx1 primary course.
Effectiveness increases to 93.8% 2 weeks after a BNT162b2 booster.
With a BNT162b2 primary course, effectiveness drops from 88.2% 2-9 weeks after dose 2 down to 63.5% 25+ weeks after dose 2, increasing to 92.6% 2 weeks after the booster.
Full preprint: Effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of concern
UPDATE, 10th December 2021:
“The analysis looked at 581 people with confirmed Omicron.
It showed that the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines provided much lower levels of protection against symptomatic infection compared to the protection that they provide against Delta.
However, the preliminary data showed effectiveness against the new variant appears to increase considerably in the early period after a booster dose, providing around 70% to 75% protection against symptomatic infection.

“We’re here for the people who need us”: Engaging community ambassadors to promote COVID-19 Vaccines in East Oakland’s Fruitvale Neighborhood
July 28, 2021
California Volunteers currently partners with LA Works, OneOC and the Santa Cruz Volunteer Center, three regional volunteer centers that work in eight counties across the State to mobilize volunteers around needed vaccine support.
At a Volunteer Hub convening this month, guest speaker Itzel Diaz Romo joined us to continue the conversation about engaging grassroots volunteers and promoting COVID-19 vaccines in communities disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.
The discussion sparked reflection, questions and collective learning focused on equity, inclusion, and culturally responsive volunteer strategies
Itzel is the Senior Manager of Communications and External Affairs at The Unity Council, a nonprofit Social Equity Development Corporation with a 55-year history building community resilience and enhancing the quality of life of residents in Oakland’s Fruitvale neighborhood.
The Council’s holistic and community-centered programs and services reach more than 11,000 individuals and families annually in five languages.
COVID-19 has hit East Oakland’s primarily low income, Latino and Black residents particularly hard, with one of the highest infection, hospitalization, and death rates and lowest percentage vaccinated in the Bay Area.
In response to this disparity, The Unity Council joined forces with UCSF and La Clínica de la Raza early in the pandemic offer COVID testing, prevention protocols and more recently, vaccine outreach and administration.
According to Itzel, Fruitvale is still at great risk from the virus: “Only 50% of adults are vaccinated and the neighborhood remains in the county’s top 3 zip codes for virus infections.”
Through their partnership with La Clínica and UCSF, the Council has mobilized Community Ambassadors, multi-ethnic and multilingual local college-aged student volunteers, and Promotoras, Spanish speaking women who live and work in the neighborhood to serve as trusted messengers, promoting vaccine confidence and access.
As a part of their service, both Ambassadors and Promotoras receive a stipend.
They also have the opportunity to gain professional skills by participating in a series of trainings and panels through La Clínica de la Raza with topics ranging from the science of the virus and of vaccines, to effective community outreach and careers in the field of public health.

San Francisco CNN Business —
The pandemic shone a spotlight on the vast disparities in benefits and rights among America’s workforce and helped fuel a movement to unionize more workers.
And with today’s tight labor market, workers continue to have the upper hand — there are almost two job openings for every unemployed person — creating an environment that’s even more favorable to labor union activity.
In the last year, unions have been formed at big corporations such as Starbucks, Amazon, and Alphabet; union election petitions filed with the National Labor Relations Board from October 2021 through March 2022 were up 57% from the same period a year before; and a September Gallup poll found that 68% of Americans surveyed were in favor of labor unions – the highest level of approval since 1965.
But as the war in Ukraine, record gas prices and spiraling inflation continue to put pressure on the US economy, what remains to be seen is whether the newly robust labor movement could weather higher unemployment and an eventual economic downturn.
The extraordinary conditions that created this more pro-worker market won’t last forever, said Heidi Shierholz, president of the Economic Policy Institute and former chief economist for the US Department of Labor under President Barack Obama.
“To the extent that has contributed to this increase in workers organizing … that will abate,” she said.
“But how much momentum will have been established before that time, it’s not going to be zero.”
“This daily drumbeat of seeing workers win when they’re trying to organize, that’s not going to be quickly unlearned,” she added.

In April, workers at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island were the first to vote to successfully unionize in the company’s history; what began as a slow drip of unionizing Starbucks stores now totals more than 100 locations; employees at Apple stores in Georgia and New York and, just last week, a Massachusetts Trader Joe’s, are trying to do the same, citing concerns related to health and safety, pay, benefits, hours and working conditions.
Noel Bennett is a shift supervisor at a Starbucks in Santa Cruz, California, that voted to unionize last month.
For workers at her store, it came down to a simple desire: To have their voices heard.
“I think, especially due to the pandemic and seeing how corporations might not really think about the worker and workers’ experiences, I think that’s what really made partners at Starbucks realize that what’s happening could be better, and that unionization can be that thing that allows us to have a voice and to obtain the ability to live in this economy,” she told CNN Business.
The latest batch of unionization efforts are still likely heavily influenced by pandemic-related issues and demands placed on workers, but the current economic state is layering in other factors, said Ileen DeVault, professor of labor history at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations.
“I think many of these efforts at unionization are still concerned about workers’ treatment in the workplace, whether that’s health and safety issues or hours of work or expectations about how much work is going to be accomplished,” she said.
“I do think that inflation and, in particular, the ridiculous rise in gas prices is also really on workers’ minds.”
But the current economy also benefits workers, DeVault said, adding that it’s easier to risk one’s job when there are plenty of other positions available.
Also contributing to a potentially favorable environment are actions taken by the Biden Administration, which has explicitly promoted pro-union measures, including creating the White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment, which in February released nearly 70 recommendations for action; tapping former union leaders and lawyers to fill key roles such as Secretary of Labor and general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board; and backing the Protecting the Right to Organize Act of 2019, which is stalled in the Senate after passing the House of Representatives last year.
Yet despite the tight labor market and Biden’s efforts, union membership is not as common as it once was.
In 2021, 14 million workers belonged to a union, the lowest number since 1983, when comparable data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics was available.
And from the perspective of the business community, an increase in petitions and one-off unionization votes does not necessarily make a movement.
“These campaigns tend to be very site-specific,” said Glenn Spencer, senior vice president of the US Chamber of Commerce’s employment policy division.
Spencer noted while workers at one Amazon facility in New York voted to unionize, workers at another site there opted not to.
“And I think if you look at even the individual Starbucks that are organizing, it’s 100 stores out of 17,000, so there’s not this broad movement sweeping through the company.”
Spencer said the Chamber is paying particular attention to developments at the NLRB and other federal agencies.

“We need to be very mindful of the regulatory framework that employers are operating under, so if there are changes to the rules that we can’t prevent, then we just need to make sure that employers know how to adapt to that new reality,” he said.
The actions in recent months, albeit relatively small, could have an outsized influence on efforts to come, DeVault said in an interview with CNN Business.
“Those are being talked about in newspapers and TV stories and radio stations across the country,” she said.
“And so it means that the idea of forming a union is suddenly available to almost every American.”
Tristian Martinez, an organizer for the Amazon Labor Union, told Delyanne Barros, host of CNN Audio’s Diversifying podcast, he hopes that to be the case.
“We did it; we took on one of the richest companies in the world and we won,” Martinez said on Diversifying’s latest episode.
“I hope and pray that there will be just a mountain of other dominoes falling everywhere.
I only see it getting bigger and bigger.”
On the way home from a jog one afternoon in early July, Dr. Silvia Chiang noticed her husband and 2½-year-old daughter playing outdoors with a handful of neighborhood kids and their moms in face masks.
As someone who specializes in pediatric infectious diseases and has helped care for dozens of children with Covid-19, Chiang said she felt uneasy at one point.
“I think at the height of the epidemic here, I would have asked them not to do that, to come inside,” said Dr. Chiang, M.D., an assistant professor at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University.
“But at that time, Rhode Island had pretty good control of the virus.
Case counts continued to drop.
So, I felt a lot more comfortable.”
Not that she thought the risk was zero, just that it was fairly low.
Plus, Dr. Chiang knew the parents of two of the kids, both doctors, and they, too, were conscientious in their protection measures.
Dr. Chiang’s post-jog decision reflects how many parents are thinking about the coronavirus and their children.
Just weeks away from what some hope will be a return to school in the fall, many Americans are looking to new research findings and guidance — some of which suggest kids are less likely to get, spread or suffer from Covid-19 — and recalibrating the precautions they take.
If someone has a fever and feeling fatigue, do they have COVID-19?
If someone has a cough and a runny nose, is it allergies?
If someone has a headache and a sore throat, it must be the flu.
Right?
Wrong!
“With COVID-19, the flu and allergies having similar symptoms, it can be difficult to tell them apart,” said Naval Medical Readiness Training Unit NMRTU Norfolk Naval Shipyard (NNSY)
Occupational and Environmental Medicine Physician and Clinic Director Cmdr.
Scott Welch.
“However, each has some more common symptoms that distinguish them from one another.”
The differences are how quick a person would start to have symptoms.
Allergies are quicker than flu, which is quicker than COVID-19.
The main symptoms vary in that the flu and COVID-19 will likely have a cough and fever, but flu will be a dry cough, and COVID-19 may also have the loss of smell and taste.
Allergies, on the other hand, will just lead to a stuffy nose and itchy, watery eyes without a fever or cough.
So what exactly are the difference between COVID-19, the flu and allergies?
Both COVID-19 and the flu are caused by viruses- COVID-19 by the SARS CoV-2 (a coronavirus) and the flu by influenza (an orthomyxovirus).
“Both of these have the potential to make us ill and can also be spread to others and make them sick,” said Welch.
“On the other hand, allergies are caused by our body having a response to allergens - pollen, dander, mold, etc.
We will be uncomfortable, but typically the seasonal allergies will not make us ill and we can’t pass them on to others as they aren’t infectious.”
The tricky part about infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and influenza is that there is more impact than just to the individual.
There is the “collateral damage” to others, and since each person is different, there is no guarantee that just because one person had a mild course of disease, that someone they pass it on to will have the same course.
“We continue to suffer through this pandemic because we are putting individual liberties and freedoms ahead of the common good,” said Welch.
“In the end, we all suffer - through illness and death of loved ones, which can lead to lost time at work or, even worse, lost workers, which contributes to shortages in manufacturing of goods and delivery of services.
It also causes a shortage in our health care resources, not just for COVID-19 related issues, but for other diseases and disorders.”
Prevention is the best line of defense.
It is all about staying vigilant on the basics, including mask wearing, physical distancing, washing hands and getting vaccinated to better prevent the spread of the virus.
The more the viruses are allowed to spread, the greater the risk of them mutating into more dangerous variants.
This happens every so often with influenza, such as the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, but COVID-19 is proving to be more dangerous in how much easier it spreads, how much sicker it makes people, and how quickly it mutates into more concerning variants.
For allergies, individuals should try to avoid what triggers reactions and take some over-the-counter or prescribed medication to dampen the body’s response if needed.
For all federal employees and active duty military, the COVID-19 vaccine is mandated.
Federal employees, active duty, retired and reserved military personnel and their dependents can receive their vaccination at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (NMCP), or at a variety of pharmacies throughout the area.
For NMCP, you can use the Defense Health Agency appointment portal https://informatics-stage.health.mil/COVAX to schedule a vaccine appointment.
They can also get their vaccination out in town at various pharmacies and vaccination centers.
To schedule a visit out in town go to www.vaccine.gov.
The flu vaccination is also recommended and, in some cases, mandatory.
“For health care workers at many health care facilities, such as all military facilities, including NMCP and service members, it is required,” said Welch.
“Regardless, it is always recommended to get the flu vaccine for the same reasons that the COVID-19 vaccines have been recommended.
It helps reduce the risk for severe disease and for passing it along to others, especially those who cannot get the vaccine and who are more at risk for severe disease and death.
The flu vaccine is available at NMCP, primary care physicians, and pharmacies.”
Always remember that during the pandemic, it’s important to take after NASA.

More than one year into the Covid-19 pandemic, the world is grappling with a highly transmissible delta variant that has caused a renewed surge in infections in countries from the U.K. and the U.S., to those in Africa and Asia.
The delta variant, which was first detected in India last October, has been found in more than 130 countries globally, according to the World Health Organization.
Delta is the most transmissible variant of the coronavirus that first emerged in China in late 2019, said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, an epidemiologist and technical lead for Covid-19 at the WHO.
"The virus itself, as it starts, is a dangerous virus, is a highly transmissible virus.
The delta variant is even more so — it's doubly more transmissible than the ancestral strain, it's 50% more transmissible than the alpha strain," she said at a WHO media briefing last week.
The alpha variant was first detected in the U.K. Globally, the number of reported Covid-19 cases crossed 200 million on Wednesday and more than 4.2 million people have died from it, data compiled by Johns Hopkins University showed.
Prevalence of delta variant
Delta is one of four "variants of concern" listed by the WHO.
Such variants are deemed to be more contagious, more resistant to current vaccines and treatments, or could cause more severe illness.
The delta variant has become the dominant strain causing Covid-19 in many countries.
Around 65 countries detected Covid cases caused by the delta variant in the four weeks to Aug. 5, according to genetically sequenced coronavirus samples collected by GISAID.
GISAID is a platform for scientists to share information on viruses, and its data is widely used by the global scientific community, including the WHO.
Data on the prevalence of the Covid delta variant likely underestimates the actual situation because some countries don't share sequenced samples with GISAID, while others may lack the capability and resource to do viral sequencing.
In 55 of those countries, the delta variant accounted for over half the virus samples submitted, data compiled by GISAID showed.
Vaccine effectiveness
The Covid delta variant has not spared countries with some of the highest vaccination rates globally.
Israel, where more than 62% of the population have been fully vaccinated, reported an increase in daily cases over the past month as delta became the dominant strain in the country.
As the delta variant spread in Israel, the health ministry found that the effectiveness of the two-dose Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine dropped to just 39%, even though protection against severe illness remained high.
The country has started to administer booster shots to people over age 60.
But a study in the U.K., where the delta variant is also fueling a rise in infections, found that two doses of Pfizer -BioNTech or the vaccine by AstraZeneca -Oxford University were nearly as effective against delta as they were against the alpha variant.
The study published in the New England Journal of Medicine used real world data, and found that two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were 88% effective against the delta variant.
That's compared to 93.7% against the alpha strain, it said.
The AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine was found to be 67% effective against delta, compared to 74.5% effectiveness against the alpha variant, according to the study.
Oregonians at risk for a severe COVID infection now have access to free online health care visits thanks to a new state program.
The Oregon Health Authority announced Tuesday that a California-based health care company, Color Health, will offer telehealth sessions online or on the phone to Oregonians who at risk of developing a severe COVID infection.
They include people aged 65 and over and those with compromised immune systems.
The visits will be free and available to everyone, regardless of their insurance status.
The program will run through the end of December and could cost the state up to $1.2 million, according to the contract, which the Capital Chronicle obtained through a public records request.
Jonathan Modie, a spokesman for the health authority, said the program will serve up to 600 people a week.
The contract was signed Sept. 12.
Modie said the agency waited to secure funding to launch it.
Its purpose is to help Oregonians at risk for severe COVID gain access to an antiviral medication without leaving home.
Schedule a visit Visit Color.com/COVID-19-treatment-OR and take the survey or call 833-273-6330 and describe your symptoms.
Join the video or phone call.
Prescriptions can be picked up at a local pharmacy or delivered to homes free of charge.
Those given a prescription can pick it up at their local pharmacy or get home delivery.
For follow-up questions, email [email protected].
The service is available from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week, and consultations are offered in 17 languages.
For more information, visit COVID-19 treatments or call the company at 833-273-6330.
She said the program will especially benefit communities hit hardest by COVID, including tribal nations and communities of color.
The program aims to reach people who are uninsured or underinsured, Modie said.
Nearly 6% of Oregonians lack health insurance.
“Many people who are underinsured or uninsured, or who are unable to access a test to treat site, have a difficult time accessing a clinician who can prescribe antiviral medications.”
Modie said.
“This program allows people to talk to a clinician virtually, without having to leave their home, and get a prescription right away if they qualify.”
One of the antivirals, Paxlovid, was approved by the Federal Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization late last year and has been widely taken, including by President Joe Biden this summer.
In a clinical trial, it was 90% effective at preventing severe symptoms in unvaccinated patients.
It is available to people aged 12 and older who’ve tested positive for COVID and are at risk of severe symptoms.
The three-pill-a-day regimen has to start within five days of the onset of symptoms and continue for five days.
Modie said patients have to declare that they had a positive test but do not have to produce proof of one.
If the Color Health provider considers it appropriate, they will prescribe Paxlovid.
Oregon appears to have enough Paxlovid to meet the demand.
The health authority receives 1,180 courses of Paxlovid per week from the federal government for distribution to hospitals, clinics and local pharmacies, Modie said.
“Additionally, Paxlovid is widely available in hundreds of retail Oregon pharmacies,” Modie said.
“According to our numbers, we have about 14,000 courses of Paxlovid throughout the state, including pharmacies.”
Experts say Paxlovid is effective against omicron, which helped put 1,130 people in the hospital last January.
Since then, the pandemic has slowed, with fewer people hospitalized, fewer cases emerging every day on average and fewer deaths.
But people are still getting sick, going to the hospital and dying.
Oregon Health Authority data shows that more than 8,700 people in Oregon have died from COVID and at least 914,000 have been infected.
The state does not log most at-home tests.
People 65 and over have continued to account for the highest number of hospitalizations.
Right now, about 230 people with COVID are hospitalized, including nearly 30 in intensive care units.
That compares with 1,130 people hospitalized last January.
As in most other countries, the government in the Netherlands has implemented generous support measures for firms during the Covid-19 crisis, aiming to prevent unnecessary bankruptcies and protect jobs.
The extensive support packages run the risk of harming future productivity growth due to reduced creative destruction, i.e. the cleansing of the least productive firms in the economy in the competitive process.
This risk is positively related to the generosity of the support and the length of the support period.
Evidence for France records creative destruction has not been distorted throughout 2020 (Cros et al. 2021) and that support has been evenly distributed across firms of different productivities (Bénassy-Quéré et al. 2021).
Bighelli et al. (2021) show support has impacted productivity positively by flowing disproportionally to high productivity firms in several other EU countries, mirroring the French results.
In contrast, while successful at keeping firms afloat, government support in the Netherlands disrupted creative destruction.
Like in many other countries, the number of bankruptcies was historically low in 2020.
We find the exit rate was considerably lower among supported firms than for those that were not supported.
At the same time, low productivity firms have received support more often and more generously (relative to their size).
Consequently, we observe that the exit rate declined the most for firms with the lowest productivity.
We focus on the two largest (by expense) support measures.
This first, wage cost subsidies (NOW) rounds 1, 2, and 3, was available to all firms with employees that expected Covid-19-related revenue losses of at least 20%.
The second, tax deferral was open to all firms with very few prerequisites and allowed them to postpone most of their tax payments.
Take-up for firms with employees was roughly 27% for NOW and 55% for tax deferral (CBS 2021).
Some of the NOW advances (if realised revenues are higher than expected) and all of the tax deferrals will have to be paid back in the future.
We use data from balance sheets of all non-financial corporations in 2019 and link these to their use of support measures in 2020.1
Firm dynamics in 2020
Dutch business dynamics in 2020 stand in stark contrast to the 2008-2009 recession, when dynamics reacted strongly to the economic turmoil (see Figure 1).
Entries and exits in 2020 changed little compared to 2019, particularly for larger firms.
Additionally, Figure 2 shows the number of bankruptcies (subset of exits) decreased strongly during 2020 (Overvest and Fareed 2021).2
Figure 1 Firm dynamics relatively stable in 2020
Figure 2
The number of bankruptcies declined strongly
Furthermore, the share of exits is much lower for supported firms than for unsupported firms.
Figure 3 shows, per industry, the share of exits among unsupported (horizontal axis) and supported firms (vertical axis).
Virtually all points are well below the 45-degree line, indicating the exit rate of supported firms is considerably lower than that of unsupported firms.
Figure 3 Supported firms exit less than unsupported firms
The exit rate among unsupported firms was highest in industries hardest hit by the lockdown, found towards the far right-hand side of Figure 3.
These industries include sports and recreation, hospitality, and casinos.
In these industries the exit rate among unsupported firms was more than 15%; for supported firms, it was less than 5%.
Dynamics and productivity
Replacing low-productivity firms with new, highly productive firms is an important driver of productivity growth and the mechanism behind creative destruction (Freeman et al. 2021).
Table 1 shows the exit rate per decile of the distribution of labour productivity, which is calculated as value added per hour worked.
In accordance with creative destruction, the percentage of exits in the lowest productivity decile in 2018 and 2019 was substantially higher (at about 10%) than for the rest of the distribution (4-5%).
In 2020, the share of exits was lower for all groups.
However, it fell most for the lowest productivity firms: by eight percentage points compared to the two to four percentage points for the other groups.
This suggests that the creative destruction dynamic was disrupted in 2020.
This finding holds not just on aggregate but also within industries.
Table 1
Percentage of exits per year per productivity decile, all non-financial corporations
Source: Own calculations based on CBS microdata.
Support and labour productivity
We zoom in on two components using a panel regression: first, we relate the productivity distribution to the share of supported firms; second, we relate it to the support-amounts scaled by revenue in 2019.
The two components result from interactions with ten and five group dummies, which cover the productivity distribution.
Fixed effects are included to control for industry differences.
This means that the results are not driven by industry-specific differences in support take-up.
Figure 4 Low productive firms received support more often
Figure 5 Low productive firms received more support
For both support measures, Figure 4 shows firms with the lowest productivity received support most often, with the share of firms receiving support rapidly dropping for higher productivity deciles (each horizontal segment presents 10% of all firms).
Similarly, Figure 5 shows low-productivity firms received the highest amount of support relative to their revenue in 2019.
This is presented for five groups (quintiles) instead of deciles, as it is restricted to supported firms only.
Recall the pattern we see in Table 1: a notable lower exit rate in 2020, particularly for the least productive firms.
This fits with the observation that firms in low-productivity groups received support more often and received more support.
Combining these findings suggests that low-productivity firms have been kept alive disproportionately by government support.
Conclusion
The main objective of the support policy has been achieved: firms, and with them jobs, have been preserved through the Covid-19 crisis.
The government support measures had to be quick and simple, contain few conditions, and have low implementation costs.
At the same time, we find that the support ended up disproportionally with less-productive firms.
As a result, these firms survived longer than might have been expected based on pre-2020 patterns of exits.
This disruption of the dynamics did not occur in other countries (Bighelli et al. 2021, Cros et al. 2021).
This raises the question of why the Dutch government’s support during Covid-19 appears to have impacted firm dynamics more adversely than elsewhere.
Perhaps the support measures were more widely and readily available.
Qualification for NOW support was easy, starting at a low expected revenue-loss cut-off, and many recipients were overly pessimistic about their drop in revenues and received too much in advances (Schellekens et al. 2021), while tax deferral had no cut-off at all.
Of course, the ubiquity of Dutch support measures might have limited other adverse Covid-19-related impact, such as job losses.
Finally, the results reflect the situation in 2020.
Current data do not allow us to say how the dynamics will be affected by the phasing out of support measures, which commenced in late 2021.
It is possible that some firms have been propped up by support and will fail once it stops.
Moreover, firms will have to pay back some or all of the support received.
This might lead to a stronger process of creative destruction in the near future.
The speed of the phasing out phase will play an important role in this development (Overvest and Smid 2021).

The data on support measures relate to the state of affairs up to and including 31 December 2020.
The amounts we show therefore consist of advances or payment deferrals and not necessarily definitive payments.

Key points COVID vaccine research was far better funded than HIV.
COVID vaccines built on decades of previous research in related viruses and HIV.
Because of available treatment and prevention, HIV vaccine trials are more challenging to conduct than for COVID.
The long search for an HIV vaccine contrasts with the unprecedentedly fast development of vaccines for COVID, in which at least seven (Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax, Oxford/AstraZeneca, Johnson and Johnson, and the Chinese Sinovac and Russian Sputnik vaccines) were ready for distribution within little more than a year from the start of the epidemic.
Apart from the technical difficulties of dealing with HIV (see Why is it so difficult to make an HIV prevention vaccine?)
there are other reasons COVID vaccines were developed so quickly.
COVID vaccines had funding.
It is estimated that governments poured $52 billion into research in one year.
In contrast the total funding for HIV prevention research – not just vaccines but also things like PrEP – was $1.13 billion in 2019.
At the 2020 International AIDS Society conference prevention researcher Professor Lynn Morris said that HIV vaccines “would be further along” if they had had the resources given to COVID.
COVID vaccines had precedents.
Much of the early research into making a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was already underway: it had been started during the 2002-2004 epidemic of SARS, caused by the closely related SARS-CoV-1.
The innovative technologies of the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines had been investigated since the early 1990s when they were first suggested as vaccine candidates.
The timing happened to be right for their success.
COVID vaccines had incidence.
It is easier to test a vaccine for a common disease than a rare one because if you have a lot of cases, it’s also easier to prove you have prevented some of them.
It is estimated that there have been nearly 250 million COVID infections so far.
In contrast there have only been an estimated 79 million people infected with HIV in 35 years.
The success of antiretrovirals as both treatment – which makes people non-infectious – and, increasingly, PrEP, has made life more difficult for HIV vaccine research for both practical reasons and ethical ones too.
Vaccine trials (and ones of new PrEP technologies) cannot ethically withhold other prevention methods from subjects.
People taking part are offered the effective prevention methods we already have, including PrEP and condoms.
This means that rates of infection are quite low, which implies either unfeasibly large trials – or estimating what would have happened if prevention technologies had not been available at all.
COVID vaccines had a fast virus, not a slow one.
COVID kills, when it does, within a month or two.
HIV takes ten years.
This enabled the vaccine trials to measure their vaccine’s efficacy against preventing symptoms, hospitalisations and deaths – which are obvious and easily measured.
Infections, whether of COVID or HIV, are more complex to measure.
COVID vaccines had efficacy.
This was not luck: it is to do with the immune reaction against the COVID spike protein being much stronger and more specific than against HIV proteins.
HIV does not usually produce an immune response that is enough to stop or contain infection (see Why is it so difficult to make an HIV prevention vaccine?).
The effectiveness of the four double-shot vaccines by Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax and Oxford/AstraZeneca in preventing symptomatic COVID disease is estimated to be between 79 and 95%.
However, it is more difficult to make a case for an only partially effective vaccine, as has been shown recently by the new malaria vaccine, which by itself prevents 39% of malaria cases and 29% of severe disease.
The risk/benefit balance of efficacy versus side effects is also less in the vaccine’s favour.
The first challenge of this research is to operationalise the concept of nostalgic music.
‘Nostalgic’ is a relative adjective.
Nostalgic music to people in their 30s today may refer to songs of the 1990s, while adolescents may regard albums of their favourite singers from 5 years ago as nostalgic.
It is thus difficult to pin down a universal definition of a choice being nostalgic.
If we could identify Spotify users and their ages, we might be able to specify a flexible time frame for constructing a relative definition.
As Spotify does not make the personal information of users publicly available, this work instead relies on an absolute definition of ‘old’ music, which is supposed to induce nostalgia.
Any songs older than 5 years on the day of being played are considered old music, in contrast to recent music.
A binary measure of old music is constructed accordingly.
Setting the threshold at 5 years is arguably reasonable given that, first, to evoke nostalgia a song must be familiar to the listener, i.e. a song from one’s past; and second, more than half the user base is aged under 34.Footnote 4 Understandably, some readers may not agree with describing old songs as nostalgic; old songs do not necessarily give rise to listeners’ nostalgia.
Stepping back, I ask, if a lockdown induced more frequent listening to old songs, what is a reasonable explanation?
The most straightforward one is that music listeners sought nostalgia, which old songs may provide.
Notably, nostalgic songs are not necessarily songs released during one’s past, but songs one listened to in the past.
Meanwhile, only old songs can satisfy one’s demand for music nostalgia.
Was there such a demand?
The existing literature points to similar trends in the proliferation of nostalgic entertainment or nostalgia-seeking behaviour during the pandemic (Gammon and Ramshaw, 2021;
Gibbs and Egermann, 2021; Howlin and Hansen, 2022).
Discarding this explanation, one does not identify many others.
One possible explanation, which this paper will test, is that the revival of old songs is a result of a need for positivity.
If old songs are on average more positive, the need for positivity would lead to a surge in listening to old music.
Or simply, old songs are better songs, which were somehow discovered by Spotify users.
Footnote 5 Similar explanations that do not regard nostalgia as a driving force would need to identify the possible channels through which music listeners know those old songs.
Even if one identifies a possible channel, it would need to show that the channel impacted society so much that it altered the general trend observed in Spotify streaming data.
To remain prudent, before reaching the end of the empirical analysis this work resorts to the division of music into old and recent songs, but then apply the explanation this work suggests and infer whether people listened more frequently to nostalgic music during the early phase of the pandemic.
The data, however, do not allow us to infer the emotional status of the music listeners, or pinpoint the motive behind any behavioural changes.
The objective of this study is to leverage the observational data on a popular music streaming platform and draw insights for the understanding of human behaviour during the pandemic.
Figure 1 shows the number of plays of old and recent songs from January 2020 to July 2020 with a vertical reference line indicating the beginning of the lockdown on 26 March.
Footnote 6
Although old music only accounts for a relatively small number of plays, the upward trend since the end of March is fairly distinguishable.
Figure 2 gives a clear illustration by presenting the information as a proportion of the total number of plays of daily top 200 songs and concentrates on the region below 25%.
The rise in old music is easily recognisable.

To explain the choice of music, I employ a logistic regression in which each play is a choice between a set of old songs (released more than 1825 days before the day of observation, t) and a set of recent songs.
Each charted song on a day is associated with a binary variable indicating its old/recent dimension (old music listening = 1), which is the dependent variable and weighted by its frequency of plays during the day in the logistic regression.
Footnote 7 Note that the dataset is truncated as the identity and number of plays of the songs ranked below 200 are not publicly available.
This problem is not prohibitive since the number of decisions being considered in the regression is large, reaching roughly 20 million a day (more than 4 trillion in the whole sample period) in the UK.
The main explanatory variable is a lockdown indicator (equals 1 if t ≥ tL, the lockdown implementation day, and 0 otherwise).
No ending date of the lockdown is coded for two reasons.
The first is that the lockdown was gradually relaxed, with some restrictions remaining throughout the summer.
The second is that the lockdown was announced only shortly before its actual implementation, as the government had wanted to minimise chaotic traffic as much as possible.
By contrast, the relaxation was announced some weeks before it took place.
One would therefore expect the lockdown to have induced a shock, but the relaxation would have led to only gradual adjustments.
As the model allows for a quadratic trend in old music listening during the in-lockdown period, it should be sufficient to capture a possible non-linear effect from the beginning of the lockdown to its progressive relaxation in July.
To support the inclusion of a non-linear trend, I check with the Oxford Stringency Index of the UK and identify a sharp increase in stringent measures in late March, followed by a gradual relaxation from the end of April, as shown in Fig.
3.

Another explanatory variable of interest is the Covid-19 incidence rate, which enters the regression as the natural logarithmic transformation of the 7-day moving average of the number of daily confirmed Covid-19 cases per million of the population.
The 7-day moving average is computed by averaging the numbers of new Covid-19 cases per million over the past 6 days and the day of observation.
This work employs an equal-weighted 7-day moving average to measure the extent of Covid-19 infections because it gives a better measure of how people perceived the pandemic than the daily number.
It also corrects the reporting delays of weekends, holidays and some exceptional negative values (ex-post adjustments).
The aim of the regression analysis is to determine whether the lockdown caused users’ music listening behaviour to change and to check if, on top of the lockdown effect, the extent of Covid-19 infections provides additional explanatory power to the model.
To verify that the finding is sufficiently robust, I carry out two additional checks.
If the lockdown induced a change in behaviour, the most pronounced change in trend should be observed around the actual lockdown day.
Regressions with 20 other hypothetical dates, ranging from 10 days before to 10 days after the first lockdown day, are run to see if we can credibly infer causality from the lockdown to the behavioural change.
Another robustness check is to regress the same model but shift the window of analysis to the same period (January–July) in 2019.
This check ensures that the change in preference around mid-March is not an annual pattern.
It could be possible that, for some reason, the tendency to listen to old music takes a distinct turn and goes up every year in mid-March and then falls towards summer.
Footnote 8
Again, I examine whether the trend changes markedly at a hypothetical break.
A no-result from this check would be a strong piece of evidence that the rise in old music preference is not an annual pattern.
That would support the hypothesis that the lockdown was a significant factor driving nostalgic music listening behaviour in the first Covid-19 lockdown in the UK.
The second part of the paper aims to determine whether the rise in listening to old music is only a consequence of more frequent listening to positive music.
This challenge is reasonable, as a short study of the lyrics of some of the more prominent revived songs shows that they are on average very positive songs.
To find out if nostalgia-seeking is the most plausible explanation, I construct four variables, namely, the net numbers of plays of old positive, old negative, recent positive and recent negative songs, and then conduct a time series analysis to check if the lockdown significantly altered the trends of these four variables.
Severe cases of COVID-19 infections continue to necessitate hospitalization more than two and a half years after the pandemic first hit.
A total of 26,996 patients were hospitalized with COVID-19 in the U.S. as of Nov. 30, 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s COVID-19 Tracker,1 with a seven-day average of new deaths at 317 as of Nov. 16, 2022.
This is down 5.3% from the previous seven-day average.
But in contrast to the panic, emergency response, and mobilization for the pandemic’s early stages and steepest surges, managing COVID-19 in the hospital today has become relatively straightforward, even routine, with a handful of recognized treatments that can be used by hospitalists.
Questions and controversies more often are non-medical, reflecting politics, polarizing attitudes, and ongoing vaccination controversies.
Jennifer Babik, MD, PhD, professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at the University of California San Francisco, offered a straightforward review of the basic treatment strategies in her presentation, “Update on Inpatient Management of COVID-19,” at the Management of the Hospitalized Patient conference Oct. 13 in San Francisco.
COVID-19 management has become less complicated than it was a year or two ago, she said.
“It used to be when a week went by, I’d have to change all my slides.”
Now, Dr. Babik’s PowerPoint for her presentations on how to manage COVID-19 in the hospital can go unchanged for weeks or even months.
Some hospitalists make a distinction between patients hospitalized for COVID-19 or admitted with COVID-19, but Dr. Babik said these prepositions can be confusing.
She prefers to say patients admitted for non-COVID-19 diagnoses but who are also COVID-19-positive.
Their incidental COVID-19 infection might be mild enough that they otherwise could have received outpatient treatment for it, including oral medications.
For such patients, the hospitalist might choose to view their inpatient management as providing typical outpatient COVID-19 therapies as if they were outpatients while they receive inpatient treatments for their admitting diagnosis.
Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid), an oral antiviral granted emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December 2021, consists of two generic medications, nirmatrelvir, a protease inhibitor, and ritonavir, an antiviral medication for HIV.
It’s used for outpatient treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and children aged 12 and up.
Remdesivir, a direct-acting nucleotide prodrug inhibitor approved by the Food and Drug Administration for patients at high risk of severe COVID-19 in October 2020, is the antiviral most typically used in the hospital for COVID-19.
The first week of the illness is the viral phase, treated with antiviral therapies, Dr. Babik said.
The second is the immune or inflammatory phase, treated with immunomodulators.
But there is a lot of overlap between these categories.
She recommends the National Institutes of Health’s Guidelines on Therapeutic Management of Hospitalized Adults with COVID-19.2
Two immunomodulators, tocilizumab, an immunosuppressive drug used for rheumatoid arthritis, and baricitinib, a JAK inhibitor, given intravenously and orally, respectively, are recommended only for patients on oxygen who are rapidly worsening or who are on high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, or mechanical ventilation.
“We usually mostly do standard tests,” Dr. Babik said, sometimes including a CRP (C-reactive protein) test to identify the level of inflammation caused by severe infection.
All COVID-19 patients should have a baseline chest X-ray, but a chest CT is not needed routinely unless there is concern for an additional process.
She also recommends checking for drug-drug interactions and whether anticoagulation is indicated if using a drug like Paxlovid, and watching out for long COVID-19.
Endemic, almost routine
“Things have changed a lot over the last two years from the dark early days of the pandemic, when you were seeing so many patients dying in front of you,” Raghavendra Tirupathi, MD, FACP, FRCP, FIDSA, medical director of Keystone Infectious Diseases in Chambersburg, Penn., and chair of infection prevention at Wellspan Chambersburg and Waynesboro hospitals, said.
“Now the disease is more of an outpatient phenomenon, with more patients treated within the first five days of symptoms with oral medications, and with decreasing numbers of hospitalizations.
That has brought back some normalcy for some of us so that hospitalists can focus on other clinical conditions.
We are cautiously optimistic but need to stay prepared for what comes next,” he said.
What hospitalists worry about most is another surge that could once again stretch hospital capacity.
There are still substantial numbers of patients hospitalized for COVID-19, predominantly the unvaccinated, very elderly, or immune-compromised.
People are still dying of COVID-19 every day, Dr. Tirupathi said.
Hospitalists need to be aware of the treatment options, not only for severe COVID-19, but for management of mild-to-moderate cases and the risk for progression to severe COVID-19.
He also emphasized the opportunity for hospitalists to have informed discussions with hospitalized patients about the COVID-19 vaccine.
“Know the reasons for their reluctance and offer to start a vaccine series in the hospital.
Sometimes you can start a conversation that leads to action down the road,” he said.
“We want to take every opportunity for it.”
Aziz Ansari, DO, FAAHPM, FACP, SFHM, associate chief medical officer at Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, Ill., said his hospital is seeing fewer cases of COVID-19 respiratory failure.
“So yes, COVID-19 is changing.
I still oversee COVID-19 clinical operations, but I’ve stopped reviewing every COVID-19 case that comes through here.
We used to have COVID-19-specific multidisciplinary rounds, and we don’t do that anymore,” he said.
COVID-19 has become endemic, almost routine.
“It’s not going away, and we’re living with it.
But I don’t see masks coming off clinicians in our hospital anytime soon—if ever.”
It is still standard practice to test every new admission for the virus, and those who are positive still need to be isolated.
But COVID-19 cases aren’t localized at a designated part of the hospital anymore, he said.
“They could be in any part of the hospital except the bone marrow unit.”
For Swati Mehta, MD, CPXP, FACP, SFHM, the national director of quality and patient experience for Vituity, a physician-led health care innovation company based in Emeryville, Calif., and a practicing hospitalist at Dignity Sequoia Hospital in Redwood City, Calif., the pandemic’s impact is far from over.
“Because many patients with other chronic conditions resisted seeking medical care during the pandemic, many of them are now presenting with worsening symptoms.
When they seek care, it raises acuity levels in our hospitals.
We are often at full capacity, with scarce real estate, and a higher acuity than before the pandemic.
We struggle to see such high patient volumes, and it’s harder to transition patients with COVID-19 to skilled nursing facilities,” she said.
Hospitalists are also doing vent management and other ICU-level care and are asked to do tele-critical care, tele-evaluations, and tele-admissions, she said.
In the post-COVID-19 era, they will need to be agile for these new and different roles.
“It has reached the point where the emergency department and hospital medicine are virtually the same team.
We need to be close collaborators.”
All these demands mean increased stress and burnout for clinicians, she said.
“If another surge comes, we won’t have rested because of the continuing high census.
We never got a respite.
But we’ve learned, and we’re better prepared.”
Are hospitalists following the guidelines?
Alan Kubey, MD, FACP, is the corresponding author of a study published in April in JAMA Open Network,3 based on a December 2020 survey of hospitalists at more than 50 major academic medical centers asking if their institutional policies or protocols were aligned with accepted best clinical practice guidelines or research findings for COVID-19 treatment.
It concluded that at that time, most were doing an impressive job of translating the best available evidence and pivotal controlled trials into clinical guidelines.
But the survey did not address whether these recommendations were reaching the bedsides of hospitalized patients, or how frontline clinicians such as hospitalists were actually practicing them.
Dr. Kubey, a hospitalist at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, Penn., and at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., is a member of the HOMERuN (Hospital Medicine Reengineering Network) COVID-19 Collaborative Group, which conducted the survey.
He wonders how effectively today’s routine best practices and recommendations from NIH and others are shaping clinicians’ practice.
Doctors are burned out and tired of the COVID-19 crisis, he said.
“A lot of us have gotten numb because the fire alarm has gone on for so long.”
Plus, doctors are trained to appraise evidence and expert recommendations critically and skeptically.
And the drugs and vaccines used today were most rigorously studied for earlier variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
“We haven’t seen the same level of compelling new evidence on vaccines or immunity since the Delta variant.
What works in theory may not work in trials.
We still should be doing ongoing, real-world trials, but there’s fatigue for COVID-19 clinical trials, as well,” Dr. Kubey said.
“I believe there are doctors out there who are thinking, ‘Hey, you’re basing the recommendations on old data, and the newest data is
real-world but not RCT [randomized controlled trial], so I have some questions.
I need to see more nuanced recommendations.’”
And the best physicians know that guidelines are not mandates.
Care must be tailored to the individual right in front of them.
“This is all further complicated by members of the medical community thinking or hoping that the pandemic is over.
Does such a lack of focus lead to rationalizing under- or over-treatment at the bedside of COVID-19 patients?”
For most patients, the guidelines offer the best available evidence and best strategy, he said.
“How do we get those guidelines to the bedside, with helpful support tools, just-in-time knowledge, and clarity of messaging, to ensure that the recommended treatment strategies are reaching COVID-19 patients?
How do we make it easier for frontline clinicians to choose what’s best?”
Dr. Kubey posed.
“I truly hope this winter will be considerably better than the last two.
But I worry that many in our community are going into the winter with our heads in the sand.”
Every time the virus has been underestimated in the past, he said, there was a steep price to pay.

Health Minister Likely To Chair Review, Preparedness Meet
As Covid Cases Rise
Washington, D.C. - Today, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) and Representatives Kelly Armstrong (R-ND), Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX), and Ted Deutch (D-FL) introduced the COVID-19 Safer Detention Act of 2021 to reform the Elderly Home Detention Pilot Program and compassionate release from federal prisons during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Companion legislation was introduced in the Senate by Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Ranking Member Chuck Grassley (R-IA).
"I’m proud to introduce the COVID-19 Safer Detention Act, which would ensure that elder and vulnerable prisoners are released or transferred to home confinement for the remainder of their sentence during the COVID-19 pandemic," said Chairman Nadler.
"This legislation, which expands upon programs already supported by previous bipartisan measures enacted by Congress, is especially critical as we work to put this pandemic behind us once and for all.
I thank Representatives Armstrong, Jackson Lee, and Deutch for joining me in this bipartisan effort to prevent further COVID-19 outbreaks in our federal prisons.
"
"There is bipartisan agreement that we need commonsense home confinement and early release programs," said Rep. Armstrong.
"Our legislation will take the important step of clarifying and expanding existing compassionate release policies, ensuring that eligible non-violent prisoners have access to these programs as they reintegrate into society.
"
"The pandemic has been a deadly public health crisis for every segment of our society, including incarcerated individuals," said Rep. Jackson Lee, Chair of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security.
"This bipartisan legislation is needed to ensure that the most vulnerable and elderly individuals in federal prison can be considered for home confinement or release, as appropriate.
We can and must make our system more just, and this bill is an important part of broad criminal justice reform.
"
"Elderly prisoners are among the most vulnerable populations in prisons," said Rep. Deutch.
"This bipartisan bill makes important clarifications to existing prisoner programs and includes my legislation to allow prisoners to use their good time credit when seeking to transition to home confinement for the remainder of their sentence.
Not only is this bill the humane thing to do and will protect prisoners, staff, and surrounding communities from COVID-19 outbreaks, but it will also reduce federal costs in our prison system.
"
The COVID-19 Safer Detention Act would reform the Elderly Home Detention Pilot Program and compassionate release by:
Clarifying that the percentage of time served required for the Elderly Home Detention Pilot Program should be calculated based on an inmate’s sentence, including “good time” credits earned through good behavior in prison (building upon H.R. 4018, which passed the House by voice vote last Congress);
Expanding the eligibility criteria for the Elderly Home Detention Pilot Program to include nonviolent offenders who have served at least 50% of their prison sentence;
Clarifying that elderly, nonviolent offenders who violated D.C. law are eligible for the Elderly Home Detention Pilot Program and that federal prisoners sentenced before November 1, 1987 are eligible for compassionate release;
Subjecting elderly home detention eligibility decisions to judicial review (applying the First Step Act’s criteria for compassionate release determinations);
Providing that, during the period that the Federal Bureau of Prison operations are impacted by the pandemic, COVID-19 vulnerability can be considered as a basis for compassionate release; and
Reducing the period prisoners must wait for judicial review for elderly home detention and compassionate release from 30 to 10 days.
The COVID-19 Safer Detention Act is endorsed by: Americans for Prosperity, Drug Policy Alliance, Due Process Institute, Faith & Freedom Coalition, FAMM, Federal Public and Community Defenders, FreedomWorks, Innocence Project, Justice Action Network, Law Enforcement Leaders, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL), Prison Fellowship, Right on Crime, Sentencing Project, Taking Action For Good, Tzedek Association, United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, ACLU, Americans for Tax Reform, Dream Corps JUSTICE, and Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.

The Trump administration’s coronavirus treatment reimbursement program for uninsured COVID-19 patients was announced in early April and has now been in place for about five months.
This program uses money from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act’s $175 billion Provider Relief Fund to reimburse providers for treating uninsured patients with COVID-19.
So far, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) program has paid out limited reimbursement for uninsured patients and is not designed to provide the same comprehensive access and protection from high medical bills for COVID-19 treatment as traditional insurance.
One important factor limiting the reach of the HHS uninsured reimbursement program is guidance from the department that makes eligibility for reimbursement contingent upon a primary diagnosis of COVID-19.
In some cases, patients with COVID-19 who are being treated for symptoms brought on by the virus may not have a primary diagnosis of COVID-19.
Hospital groups have noted that this is particularly a problem for patients with sepsis caused by COVID-19.
In those cases, coding protocols dictate that patients are coded with sepsis as their primary diagnosis and not COVID-19.
Additionally, providers are not required to participate in this program, and patients do not have easy visibility into which providers participate.
Providers that have participated in the past are not required to continue to do so, and if providers choose to not participate, they may bill uninsured patients directly.
When uninsured patients pay for their own care, their bills are often calculated using the undiscounted “list prices” for care, which are typically much higher than the Medicare rates providers are paid through this HHS program.
Another important limitation of the policy is that this program does not guarantee reimbursement for providers—instead reimbursement is contingent on available funding.
HHS has now announced provider grant allocations that total $143.9 billion, including $20 billion in grants announced on October 1.
This leaves $31.1 billion remaining in the fund (Figure 1).
HHS has not indicated how much money—if any—is being set aside to cover the costs of treating uninsured COVID-19 patients and how it will weigh the needs of that program with the ongoing needs of providers.
KFF has estimated that hospital costs alone for these patients could ultimately be between $13.9 billion to $41.8 billion, depending on how many people become infected and are admitted to a hospital.
HHS’s program will reimburse for both hospital costs along with many other services including office visits (including telehealth), non-emergency transportation, and for post-acute care.
Providers accepting reimbursement are paid at Medicare rates and are prohibited from billing patients.
HHS has made data publicly available on the amount it has paid out to providers who have requested reimbursement for treating uninsured COVID-19 patients.
The most recent data available includes reimbursements to providers as of September 30, 2020 and shows a modest total of $881 million in payments, though more provider reimbursements are likely waiting to be processed.
That data lists about 8,000 providers who have received reimbursement for care for uninsured patients (providers with the same name in the same state were only counted once).
As discussed above, part of the reason for the relatively low total amount that has been reimbursed through this fund is likely due to the program being limited to patients with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19.
Additionally, it is also unclear how many uninsured COVID-19 patients are being billed for their care because their providers are unaware of this program or have chosen to not participate.
While large hospitals are likely participating in the program, smaller providers may not be aware of this source of funding or they may face administrative barriers to submitting claims and getting reimbursed.
The reimbursement program is, by design, different from policy approaches that would instead promote access to affordable health coverage, which would provide broader protections for people who are uninsured or at risk of becoming uninsured.
Policy options that enable people to afford and enroll in comprehensive health insurance would help them access care for all their health care needs, including possible COVID-19 testing and treatment, although these policies would likely increase government spending.
Such policies range from subsidizing COBRA so that people can afford to maintain employer sponsored coverage after a layoff, increasing Medicaid coverage, and creating a new open enrollment period for marketplace coverage and potentially increasing subsidies to make that coverage more affordable.
The number of new cases of COVID-19 is increasing again in many states, and nearly 30,000 people are hospitalized with the virus, many in states with larger numbers of uninsured residents, including Florida, Georgia, and Texas.
Additionally, the U.S. economy has now lost about 11 million jobs since the start of the pandemic.
While many workers originally had remained on furlough with continuing employer-sponsored health insurance, some employers are now starting to formally lay-off workers and likely discontinuing their health insurance.
Given these trends, there may be increased spending in the Trump administration’s program to reimburse for treatment for uninsured COVID-19 patients, along with new pressure to explore options for increasing access to coverage for a growing number of uninsured people during this pandemic and economic crisis.
GEORGETOWN, 29 January 2021 – Guyana today received 24,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses through the COVAX Facility, a partnership between the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).
The arrival marks a historic step towards ensuring equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines globally, in the largest vaccine procurement and supply operation in history.
This delivery is part of the first phase of deliveries for Guyana, with more vaccines expected to arrive successively during 2021.
According to the first round of COVAX allocations, Guyana is expected to continue receiving doses through May until it reaches 100,800, the amount specified by COVAX.
PAHO’s
Revolving Fund, which is responsible for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines for the countries of the Americas under the COVAX Facility, shipped 24,000 doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, manufactured by SK Bioscience of South Korea.
The vaccines arrived today at the Cheddi Jagan International Airport in Georgetown.
"Seeing this arrival is very reassuring and it means that more people will be able to be protected from COVID-19," said Dr. Luis Codina, PAHO/WHO Representative in Guyana.
"We will continue to work with the country to support vaccination along with the entire package of known public health and social measures that we know can help stop the spread of COVID-19, protect health services, and save lives.
"
Guyana is one of ten countries in Latin America and the Caribbean that are receiving vaccines at no cost through the COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC).
Guyana is the first AMC country in the Caribbean to receive the vaccines through COVAX.
“The Government of Guyana welcomes the arrival of vaccines from COVAX AMC.
These vaccines will certainly help to expand the current vaccination efforts and assist in protecting many persons who are vulnerable to COVID-19.
We will like to extend our gratitude to COVAX, PAHO/WHO, UNICEF and the UN family for their efforts in securing these vaccines for Guyana.
These vaccines will definitely help to accelerate our efforts to reach herd immunity in a timely manner,” said Dr. Frank Anthony, Minister of Health of Guyana.
“The arrival of these vaccines and the future deliveries bring hope to families, especially children, who have suffered the consequences of the crisis caused by the pandemic, with profound impacts on education, mental health, protection and food security,” said Nicolas Pron, UNICEF Representative in Guyana.
“With these vaccines more people will be protected: a key step to making sure that no one is left behind and that we are building together a better future for children and their families.”
Since the beginning of the pandemic, the UN System in Guyana has worked with government, civil society, and other partners to identify and assist the needs of the population in responding to the health crisis and its socio-economic effects.
“Under the leadership of UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, the United Nations system has come together to help countries respond to the devastating global impact of COVID-19,” said Mikiko Tanaka, UN Resident Coordinator for Guyana.
"COVAX is a hard-won global partnership to ensure no one is left behind in the path to recovery and SDGs.
"
The first case of COVID-19 in Guyana was reported in March 2020.
Since then, the country has confirmed 10,168 cases and 227 deaths as a result of infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes this disease, according to data from Guyana’s Ministry of Health as of March 28, 2021.
COVAX seeks to provide vaccines for at least 20% of the population of each participating country during 2021.
In this first round of vaccine allocation, all COVAX participating countries will receive doses to vaccinate between 2.2 and 2.6% of their population.
The only exceptions are Small Island Developing States, which will receive an allocation of vaccines to cover between 16 and 20% of their population, due to the high logistical cost of delivering small quantities of vaccines.
Until vaccination is widespread among the population, basic public health measures remain the basis of the pandemic response.
For public health authorities, this means continuing diagnostic testing, contact tracing, isolation, assisted quarantine, and quality care.
And for individuals, it means continuing to practice physical distancing, hand hygiene, the use of masks, adequate ventilation of indoor environments, and avoidance of crowded spaces.
COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance Gavi, and the World Health Organization (WHO) – working in partnership with UNICEF as key implementing partner, as well as civil society organisations, vaccine manufacturers, the World Bank, and others.

Physicians and other health professionals are on the front lines of care for patients with COVID-19.
And as multiple health workers in the U.S. have been sickened by COVID-19, it raises questions and concerns.
What should physicians and other health professionals do if they are exposed to COVID-19?
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has advice for clinicians.
What you need to know about COVID-19 Explore top articles, videos, research highlights and more from the AMA—your source for clear, evidence-based news and guidance during the pandemic.
See the Latest Updates
To answer questions about possible exposure to COVID-19, the CDC has updated their guidance for risk assessment.
This guidance is available for health personnel with potential exposure in a health care setting to patients with COVID-19.
It details risk levels and what to do if exposure occurs.
However, the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is currently incomplete and the precision of current risk assignment is limited.
When assigning risk, identify duration of exposure, clinical symptoms of the patient and whether the patient was wearing a facemask.
It’s also important to note if an aerosol generating procedure was performed and the type of personal protection equipment (PPE) used by health personnel.
The AMA encourages physicians to stay up to date on this evolving situation and has provided COVID-19 resources for doctors, other health professionals and the public.
The AMA will provide continual updates.
Access to test kits for COVID-19 are now becoming more widely available in the U.S.
The CDC is shipping tests to laboratories designated as qualified, including U.S. state and local public health laboratories, Department of Defense laboratories and select international laboratories.
Here are five epidemiologic risk factors—listed from high to no identifiable risk—and what the CDC recommends for physicians and other health professionals who might have been exposed to COVID-19.
Present in the room Present in the room
Think about the patient with COVID-19 and the procedure being performed.
If a physician or other health professional is not wearing proper PPE (their eyes, nose, or mouth were not protected) and is present in the room or performed a procedure that generated higher concentrations of respirator secretions, they are at high-risk.
Related Coverage What to do when COVID-19 enters your physician practice
The CDC recommends monitoring for COVID-19 until 14 days after the last potential exposure.
These individuals should also be excluded from work during the monitoring period.
If a fever or respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID-19 develop, immediately self-isolate and notify your local or state public health authority and health care facility promptly.
Similarly, if a physician or other health care professional had prolonged close contact with a patient with COVID-19 where the patient was wearing a facemask, but the health care provider was not wearing a facemask or respirator, the health care provider should be actively monitored for COVID-19 and be excluded from work for 14 days after the last exposure.
Learn more from the CDC about what health personnel should know about caring for patients with confirmed or possible COVID-19 infection.
Proper adherence to infection control Proper adherence to infection control
A physician wearing all recommended PPE including a facemask or respirator while having prolonged close contact with a patient who was also wearing a facemask is at low risk.
It is important to note, though, that a respirator confers a higher level of protection than a facemask.
Learn more about the CDC’s interim infection prevention and control recommendations.
For this case, physicians should monitor themselves with delegated supervision.
There are no work restrictions for these individuals.
But it is important to take your temperature twice a day and remain alert for respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID-19.
Brief interactions with patient Brief interactions with patient
Physicians and other health professionals who are not using all recommended PPE and have brief interactions with a patient, such as a quick conversation at a triage desk, are considered at low risk.
This is regardless of whether the patient with COVID-19 was wearing a facemask.
Physicians should self-monitor with delegated supervision until 14 days after last potential exposure.
No work restrictions for asymptomatic individuals is needed.
If a physician or other health professional walks by a patient with COVID-19, has no direct contact with the patient or their secretions and excretions, and has no entry into the patient’s room, there is no identifiable risk.
In this instance, no monitoring or work restrictions are needed.
Physicians and other health professionals with potential exposure to COVID-19 in community settings should have their exposure risk assessed according to CDC guidance.
If in the high or medium risk category, individuals should undergo monitoring as defined by their local or state public health authority and be excluded from work in a health care setting until 14 days after their exposure.
While contact tracing and risk assessment, with appropriate implementation of work restrictions, of potentially exposed health professionals remains the recommended strategy for identifying and reducing the risk of transmission of COVID-19, it is not practical or achievable in all situations.
Facilities could consider allowing asymptomatic health professionals who have had an exposure to a COVID-19 patient to continue to work after options to improve staffing have been exhausted and in consultation with their occupational health program.

This article was written collaboratively by members of the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility.
The authors include Saskia Hausler, Kersten Heineke, Russell Hensley, Timo Möller, Dennis Schwedhelm, and Pei Shen.
As the COVID-19 crisis rages, public life in many countries is grinding to a halt.
The human toll is enormous, with the patient caseload and deaths increasing exponentially worldwide.
On the economic side, the coronavirus has forced many businesses to cease or slow down operations.
Automotive OEMs and players within the mobility industry are among the hardest hit.
Over the long term, COVID-19 could have a lasting impact on mobility as it drives change in the macroeconomic environment, regulatory trends, technology, and consumer behaviors.
The trends may vary by region, however, so responses and outcomes for mobility players will differ by location.
Macrolevel weakness could spur consolidation among mobility players
The current crisis stands to be the most abrupt shock to the global economy in modern times.
As with other financial contractions, people will postpone discretionary purchases and increase their savings as they anticipate harder times ahead.
According to recent McKinsey research, discretionary consumer spending may decline by 40 to 50 percent, translating into a roughly 10 percent reduction in GDP and numerous second- and third-order effects.
The most immediate and visible effect of COVID-19 in the traditional automotive sector is the standstill of many OEM and supplier factories, which will likely produce 7.5 million fewer vehicles in 2020.
At the height of the crisis, over 90 percent of the factories in China, Europe, and North America closed.
With the stock market and vehicle sales plummeting, automakers and suppliers have laid off workers or relied on public intervention.
Many have secured capital by either applying for government assistance or seeking investor money, while others have extended their credit lines and suspended dividend payments.
Mobility players are also suffering.
Public-transit ridership has fallen 70 to 90 percent in major cities across the world, and the operators are burdened with uncertainty and the potential need to implement and control strict hygiene protocols—such as compulsory face masks and health checks for passengers, or restricting the number of riders in trains and stations to comply with space requirements.
Ride hailers have also experienced declines of up to 60 to 70 percent, and many micromobility and carpooling players have suspended their services.
Some governments have launched initiatives to support mobility start-ups that were hit hard by the crisis, but low cash reserves and a lack of capital in the market will most likely take their toll on many players.
Just recently, a scooter-sharing start-up laid off over 400 employees (30 to 40 percent of its workforce).
The potential weakness of some players, combined with the availability of still-cheap money, could trigger a surge in M&A activity in the mid term, leading to a long-predicted industry consolidation.
Regulatory uncertainty could increase
We believe that regulators will react differently across regions.
Some might view the crisis as an inflection point to accelerate the transition toward sustainable mobility, while others could loosen regulatory mandates to prop up their ailing automotive industries.
In some markets, potential support programs, including cash incentives for trading in old cars, could amplify the industry’s focus on sustainability and increase electric-vehicle (EV) sales above projections.
In other markets, however, regulators may relax emissions targets to support OEMs.
If physical distancing continues, city leaders might relax regulations for private mobility, at least over the short term, because people feel less vulnerable to infection in individually owned vehicles.
Leaders might also revise their regulations to give more space to pedestrians and cyclists.
For example, Bogotá, Colombia has added 76 kilometers, or 47 miles, of cycle lanes to encourage physical distancing.
Other cities, including New York City, have closed several streets to traffic.
In Oakland, California, an astounding 74 miles of streets—10 percent of the total—have been blocked off so pedestrians and cyclists can remain six feet apart.
We assume that some of those measures might remain in place after the crisis.
If they promote improvements, such as fewer accidents and less pollution, cities may decide to make them permanent.
Potential technology setbacks
Over the short to mid-term, the COVID-19 crisis could delay the development of advanced technologies, such as autonomous driving, as OEMs and investors scale back innovation funding to concentrate on day-to-day cash-management issues.
For instance, autonomous-vehicle (AV) testing may be suspended.
Similarly, investment in micromobility and shared-mobility providers might drop—a trend that would drive market consolidation.
Success (and survival) will likely favor larger players with higher cash reserves.
Over the long term, however, AVs, micromobility solutions, and other technologies that support physical distancing could benefit.
We believe that customer demand for these solutions could soar once the initial crisis subsides, increasing their attractiveness to investors.

The impact of COVID-19 on EVs will differ across regions.
For instance, we expect post-crisis EV sales to rebound strongly in China, keeping investment stable and the projected increase in EV market share on track.
We also expect investment to remain on the same trajectory in Europe—even though ramp-up of EVs might be slightly delayed, there could be strong regulatory tailwinds.
EV demand might stagnate in the United States, especially if federal regulations about emissions loosen and oil prices remain low.
These trends could slightly decrease investment in EVs and market share could fall below the projected levels for the next few years.
Changes in consumer behavior and preferences could shift the modal mix
As the pandemic continues, physical distancing will have a significant impact on mobility behavior and preferences.
Many people will switch to a transport mode that reduces the risk of infection, but the exact shifts will largely depend on their pre-COVID-19 habits.
People who own a private vehicle will use it increasingly, while those who previously relied on public transport might switch to another mode, such as biking or walking instead.
Evidence from Chinese cities confirms that private cars, walking, and biking have gained the most share since the pandemic began, while bus and subway ridership declined.
At this point, we believe many changes in the modal mix are temporary and that shared-mobility solutions, including public transit, will rebound and continue to capture increased market share.
Micromobility solutions could also pick up more quickly if strict disinfection protocols are installed.
That said, the pandemic could produce some permanent shifts over both the short and long term.
For instance, AVs, if approved for on-road use, could see higher-than-expected demand, since they enable physical distancing.
And remote work—now common during the pandemic—could become the norm if companies recognize its power.
If more people permanently work from home, the reduction in commutes would likely produce a long-term decrease in vehicle miles traveled.
Safeguarding our lives and our livelihoods: The imperative of our time
Regional variations in mobility trends
The four trends discussed—macroeconomic developments, regulatory developments, technology, and customer behavior—will evolve in different ways depending on location.
We have created scenarios to describe the landscape—both how it might evolve through 2021 and the potential next normal in 2025.
Of course, much uncertainty persists and other scenarios could emerge.
Here’s a summary.
North America
In the United States, future EV-market development depends largely on the regulatory environment and oil prices.
The latter, in turn, affect gasoline prices and the total cost of ownership of EVs (Exhibit 1).
While EV sales could return to pre-COVID-19 projections in one to two years, the specific timing depends on two factors: if and when oil prices also return to pre-COVID-19 levels and the number of states that adopt California’s emission regulations.
Although some technological innovation may now face delays, we expect investment to recover.
1
Europe
While COVID-19 will likely decrease overall car sales in Europe, it might have a limited impact on EV market share and total EV sales (Exhibit 2).
It is not likely that governments will weaken strict emission regulations; at most, they might defer or reduce penalty payments.
Shared-mobility solutions and EVs might see greater uptake during the crisis and even more afterward.
The EV market might see additional tailwinds if the government approves the green-mobility incentives that are currently under discussion.
2
China
Among countries, China is furthest along in its recovery from COVID-19.
In the future, the government might increasingly place limits on private-car ownership in cities, with limited exceptions for EVs (Exhibit 3).
The adoption of EVs and shared-mobility solutions could accelerate in urban environments.
3
Mobility will always be a basic human need.
To prepare for the future, mobility-industry players should immediately adjust their strategies to navigate the current crisis and prepare for the next normal:

Pfizer has been accused of “bullying” Latin American governments during negotiations to acquire its Covid-19 vaccine, and the company has asked some countries to put up sovereign assets, such as embassy buildings and military bases, as a guarantee against the cost of any future legal cases, according to an investigation by the U.K.-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism.
In the case of one Latin American country, demands made by the pharmaceutical giant led to a three-month delay in a vaccine deal being reached.
For Argentina and Brazil, no national deals were agreed to at all with Pfizer.
Any hold-up in countries receiving vaccines can lead to more people contracting Covid-19 and potentially dying.

Officials from Argentina and the other Latin American country, which cannot be named as it has signed a confidentiality agreement with Pfizer, said the company’s negotiators demanded more than the usual indemnity against civil claims filed by citizens who suffer serious adverse events after being inoculated.
They said Pfizer also insisted the governments cover the potential costs of civil cases brought as a result of Pfizer’s own acts of negligence, fraud, or malice.
In Argentina and Brazil, Pfizer asked for sovereign assets to be put up as collateral for any future legal costs.
One government health official who was present in the unnamed country’s negotiations described Pfizer’s demands as “high-level bullying” and said the government felt like it was being “held to ransom” in order to access lifesaving vaccines.
Campaigners are already warning of a “vaccine apartheid” in which rich Western countries may be inoculated years before lower-income regions.
Now, legal experts have raised concerns that Pfizer’s demands amount to an abuse of power.

“Pharmaceutical companies shouldn’t be using their power to limit lifesaving vaccines in low- and middle-income countries,” said Lawrence Gostin, a law professor at Georgetown University and director of the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law.
“[This] seems to be exactly what they’re doing.”
Protection against liability shouldn’t be used as “the sword of Damocles hanging over the heads of desperate countries with a desperate population,” he added.
Pfizer, which partnered with BioNTech, a German biotech, to make the vaccine, has been in talks with more than 100 countries and international bodies, and has supply agreements with nine countries in Latin America and the Caribbean: Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Uruguay.
The terms of those deals are unknown.
Pfizer declined to comment on the allegations about its demands in negotiations, citing “ongoing negotiations which are private and confidential.”
The company told the Bureau in a statement: “Pfizer and BioNTech are firmly committed to working with governments and other relevant stakeholders to ensure equitable and affordable access to our COVID-19 vaccine for people around the world.”
The company said that in addition to the nine Latin American countries with which it has struck supply agreements, it has “allocated doses to low- and lower-middle-income countries at a not-for-profit price, including an advance purchase agreement with COVAX to provide up to 40 million doses in 2021.”
COVAX is a global initiative to pool purchasing power and ensure vaccine access for low-income countries.
“We are committed to supporting efforts aimed at providing developing countries with the same access to vaccines as the rest of the world,” Pfizer said.
Most governments are offering indemnity — exemption from legal liability — to the vaccine manufacturers they are buying from.
This means that a citizen who suffers an adverse event after being vaccinated can file a claim against the manufacturer and, if successful, the government would pay the compensation.
In some countries people can also apply for compensation through specific structures without going to court.

This is fairly typical for vaccines administered in a pandemic.
In many cases, adverse events are so rare that they do not show up in clinical trials and only become apparent once hundreds of thousands of people have received the vaccine (a 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine, for example, was eventually linked to narcolepsy).
Because manufacturers have developed vaccines quickly and because they protect everyone in society, governments often agree to cover the cost of compensation.
However, the government officials from Argentina and the unnamed country who spoke to the Bureau said Pfizer’s demands went beyond those of other vaccine companies, and beyond those of COVAX, which is also requiring its member countries to indemnify manufacturers.
This presents an additional burden for some countries because it means having to hire specialist lawyers, and sometimes pass complex new legislation, so manufacturers’ liabilities can be waived.
‘An extreme demand’
Pfizer asked for an additional indemnity from civil cases, meaning that the company would not be held liable for rare adverse effects or for its own acts of negligence, fraud or malice.
This includes those linked to company practices — say, if Pfizer sent the wrong vaccine or made errors during manufacturing.
“Some liability protection is warranted, but certainly not for fraud, gross negligence, mismanagement, failure to follow good manufacturing practices,” said Gostin.
“Companies have no right to ask for indemnity for these things.”
Mark Eccleston-Turner, a lecturer in global health law at Keele University in England, said Pfizer and other manufacturers have received government funding to research and develop the vaccines and are now pushing the potential costs of adverse effects back on to governments, including those in low- and middle-income countries.
(Pfizer’s partner, BioNTech, was given $445 million by the German government to develop a vaccine and the U.S. government agreed in July to preorder 100 million doses for nearly $2 billion, before the vaccine had even entered Phase 3 trials.
Pfizer expects to make sales of $15 billion worth of vaccines in 2021.)
In Eccleston-Turner’s opinion, it looks like Pfizer “is trying to eke out as much profit and minimize its risk at every juncture with this vaccine development then this vaccine rollout.
Now, the vaccine development has been heavily subsidized already.
So there’s very minimal risk for the manufacturer involved there.”
The Bureau spoke to officials from two countries, who all described how meetings with Pfizer began promisingly but quickly turned sour, and reviewed a report by the Brazilian Ministry of Health.
The Argentinian Ministry of Health began negotiating with the company in June and President Alberto Fernández held a meeting with the company’s general manager for Argentina the following month.
During subsequent meetings Pfizer asked to be indemnified against the cost of any future civil claims, said an official from the president’s office.
Although this had never been done before, the country’s Congress passed a new law in October allowing for it.
However, Pfizer was not happy with the phrasing of the legislation, according to the official, who declined to be identified because the negotiations were confidential.
The government believed Pfizer should be liable for any acts of negligence or malice.
Pfizer, said the official, disagreed.
The government did offer to amend the existing law to make it clear “negligence” meant problems in the distribution and delivery of the vaccines.
But Pfizer was still not satisfied.
It asked the government to amend the legislation through a new decree; Fernández refused.
“Argentina could compensate for the vaccine’s adverse effects, but not if Pfizer makes a mistake,” said the official, who has detailed knowledge of the negotiations.
“For example, what would happen if Pfizer unintentionally interrupted the vaccine’s cold chain
[of -70 Celsius during transport and storage] … and a citizen wants to sue them?
It would not be fair for Argentina to pay for a Pfizer error.”
The official said talks soon became tense and complicated: “Instead of giving in on some points, Pfizer demanded more and more.”
In addition to the changes sought in the new law, it asked Argentina to take out international insurance to pay for potential future cases against the company (countries were also asked by vaccine makers and the WHO to do this during the H1N1 outbreak).
In late December, Pfizer made another unexpected request: that the government put up sovereign assets — which might include federal bank reserves, embassy buildings, or military bases — as collateral.
“We offered to pay millions of doses in advance, we accepted this international insurance, but the last request was unusual: Pfizer demanded that the sovereign assets of Argentina also be part of the legal support,” the official said.
“It was an extreme demand that I had only heard when the foreign debt had to be negotiated, but both in that case and in this one, we rejected it immediately.”
The failed negotiations mean Argentinian citizens, unlike those in neighboring countries, do not have access to Pfizer’s vaccine, leaving them with Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, AstraZeneca’s vaccine, and those delivered through COVAX.
The government is also negotiating to acquire vaccines from Moderna, Sinopharm, and CanSino.
“Pfizer misbehaved with Argentina,” said Ginés González Garcia, Argentina’s former minister of health.
“Its intolerance with us was tremendous.”
‘Good cop, bad cop’
The same demands were made of Brazil’s Ministry of Health, according to a ministry statement.
Pfizer asked to be indemnified against all civil claims and asked the ministry to put up sovereign assets as collateral, as well as create a guarantee fund with money deposited in a foreign bank account.
In January, the ministry refused these terms, describing the clauses as “abusive.”
An official from the Latin American country that cannot be named described talks unfolding similarly.
This person said the government began negotiating with Pfizer in July, before the vaccine was approved.
There was a perception that Pfizer’s negotiators had a “good cop, bad cop” routine, with the “bad cop” pressing the government to buy more doses.
“[At that time] there was not a single drug or vaccine in the world with this kind of technology that had been shown to be safe and effective.
… You had this lady putting pressure saying: ‘Buy more, you’re going to kill people, people are going to die because of you,’” the official said.
Negotiations became fraught when the company asked for additional indemnity, for civil cases alleging Pfizer’s acts of negligence, fraud, or malice.
The government had never awarded any kind of indemnity before and did not want to waive liability, but Pfizer said this was non-negotiable.
Negotiations continued and eventually a deal was signed that included the additional indemnity provisions, but after a delay of three months.
As Pfizer has only 2 billion doses to sell across the world this year — apparently on a first-come, first-served basis — the official is angry about a delay that likely pushed the country further back in the queue.
One of the reasons the government wanted Pfizer’s vaccines was because the company said they could be delivered quickly.
Yet in the contract, Pfizer wanted to reserve the right to modify the schedule.
There was no room for negotiation.
“It was take it or leave it,” said the official.
The official added: “Five years in the future when these confidentiality agreements are over, you will learn what really happened in these negotiations.”

CNN —
People who reported experiencing side effects to the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines such as fever, chills or muscle pain tended to have a greater antibody response following vaccination, according to new research.
Having such symptoms after vaccination is associated with greater antibody responses compared with having only pain or rash at the injection site or no symptoms at all, suggests the paper published Friday in the journal JAMA Network Open.
“In conclusion, these findings support reframing postvaccination symptoms as signals of vaccine effectiveness and reinforce guidelines for vaccine boosters in older adults,” the researchers – from Columbia University in New York, University of Vermont and Boston University – wrote in their paper.
But even though some people may have small, localized side effects or no symptoms at all, the vaccine still elicits robust immune responses in them too.
Nearly all study participants exhibited a positive antibody response after completing a two-dose Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine series.
“I don’t want a patient to tell me that, ‘Golly, I didn’t get any reaction, my arm wasn’t sore, I didn’t have fever.
The vaccine didn’t work.’
I don’t want that conclusion to be out there,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, who was not involved in the new study.
“This is more to reassure people who have had a reaction that that’s their immune system responding, actually in a rather good way, to the vaccine, even though it has caused them some discomfort,” Schaffner said.
The researchers analyzed data on 928 adults who self-reported what symptoms they experienced after receiving Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna Covid-19 vaccinations, as well as submitted a dried blood spot to test for antibodies.
Most of the participants were White adults, with a mean age of 65.
Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
The researchers found that after either vaccine dose, 446 or 48% of participants reported systemic symptoms while 12% reported only local symptoms and 40% reported no symptoms at all.
Meanwhile, antibody reactivity was observed in 444 or 99% of participants with systemic symptoms, 99% of those with only local symptoms and 98% of those with no symptoms.
“A lot of people have speculated over the years whether people who had more of a reaction to the vaccine might actually have that represent a more vigorous immune response,” Schaffner said.
“And these data would appear to support that.”

Effects of COVID-19 on Travel Behavior
Substitution of working at home for journeys to work during the pandemic affects many aspects of local transportation.
Commuting to work is a major element of local travel, public transit use, and peak period congestion.
Trips to stores, an activity that can be substituted by online purchasing, is also a major element of local travel, transit use, and congestion.
Start exploring data from the Census Household Pulse Survey to view changes in work from home, transit and ride-sharing trips, trips to stores, and online purchasing.
You can view the data at the national, state, or metropolitan level (15 largest).
For states and metropolitan areas, you can see which differ from the national level with statistical significance.
Effects of COVID-19 on Travel Behavior by Income Groups
How do these changes in travel behavior vary by income group?
Household income serves as a proxy for the type of jobs held by adults in the household, which can, for example, affect the ability to telework.
Household income also signals the resources available, such as a reliable internet connection for telework and online shopping or a personal vehicle to use in lieu of public transit.
View how changes differ by income groups, with statistical significance, from the $75,000-99,000 income group at the national level or for a selected state or metropolitan area.
For the third summer in a row, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that Florida has seen the most COVID-19 deaths from May to August in the United States.
What You Need To Know According to the CDC, Florida is leading the nation in summer COVID deaths for the third straight year
From May through August, the CDC reports that roughly 6,000 people died of the coronavirus
One area doctor says one of the main goals should be getting the latest vaccine to people who have not recently been infected
Even though he’s an optimist at heart, Dr. Jason Salemi said he sees the reality of the situation.
“It is hard,” he said.
“It’s hard to keep telling people there’s some simple steps we can take to protect ourselves because we’re all just sick of COVID right now.”
The fatigue from the virus has been spreading as much as the virus itself, he said.
But in that time, since May, Salemi said overall deaths from COVID-19 in Florida have been the most in the country with roughly 6,000 people dying.
Even with that information, he said the data don't tell the entire story.
“Florida is also the third largest state, so we would expect that even if they had lower rates, they’re going to be among the leaders,” Salemi said.
Because there’s a multitude of factors that have to be considered to understand why the Sunshine State stays at the top of these rankings.
Heading into the fall, and into 2023, the big goal, Salemi said, is to get the latest vaccine to people who haven’t been recently infected with COVID-19.
“It’s like having a sketch artist now draw a very definitive picture of what’s circulating and just allows our bodies to defend itself that much better,” Salemi said of the new bivalent COVID-19 vaccine.
Despite his optimism, he said the next few months are all dependent on what the community does to make sure everyone is as protected as possible from the virus.
That can be a tricky thing, Salemi said, when many people rely on free tests or medication for COVID that could soon cost people money if the federal government doesn’t renew its funding.
“Anything that can ease the burden of COVID-19 on people, we need to make sure it’s universally accessible,” he said.
"...
We’re going to need to be prepared to pivot or respond to whatever the virus throws at us."

Food security in sub-Saharan Africa is under threat.
The ability of many Africans to access sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs has been disrupted by successive natural disasters and epidemics.
Cyclones Idai and Kenneth, locust outbreaks in eastern Africa, and droughts in southern and eastern Africa are some examples.
The COVID-19 pandemic is just the latest catastrophe to have swollen the ranks of 240 million people going hungry in the region.
In some countries, over 70 percent of the population has problems accessing food.
Sub-Saharan Africa is the world’s most food-insecure region, and in the June 2020 sub-Saharan Africa Regional Economic Outlook , we show that climate change is increasing that insecurity.
The sub-Saharan is particularly vulnerable to the forces of climate change.
Almost half the population lives below the poverty line and depends on rain-fed agriculture, herding, and fishing to survive .
With each climate shock, whether drought, flood or cyclone, farmers suffer directly, while shortages elevate the price of food for all.
Lives lost, increased vulnerability
Africans are easily pushed into food insecurity because their ability to adapt is limited by many factors, including low savings and access to finance and insurance.
As a result, lives are lost, malnutrition rises, health worsens, and school enrollment drops.
All this, ultimately damages the economy’s productive capacity.
During these times of COVID-19, we are seeing these challenges play out.
The measures to contain and manage the COVID-19 pandemic, while critical to saving lives, risks exacerbating food insecurity.
Border closures, lockdowns, and curfews intended to slow the spread of the disease are disrupting supply chains that, even under normal circumstances, struggle to stock markets, and supply farmers with seeds and other inputs.
Designing COVID-19–era measures to improve food security
At this critical juncture, sub-Saharan Africa needs to prioritize policies targeted at reducing risks to food security as part of fiscal stimulus packages to counter the pandemic.
Our analysis suggests these policies should focus on increasing agricultural output, and strengthening households’ ability to withstand shocks.
This would have the added benefit of reducing inequalities while boosting economic growth and jobs.
Boosting agricultural output
Even before the pandemic, many countries in the region were proactive in protecting their food supply by raising crop productivity and reducing their sensitivity to inclement weather.
For example, Mozambique is the location of a global pilot for newly-developed, heat-tolerant bean seeds, while in Ethiopia, some farmers’ yields rose by up to 40 percent after the development of rust-resistant wheat varieties (rust is brought on by higher temperatures and volatile rainfall).
Maintaining this momentum calls for continued progress in improving irrigation, seeds, and erosion protection, all of which would substantially boost production.
Meanwhile raising farmers’ awareness would also accelerate implementation of these measures.
Withstanding shocks: An outsized impact
Adapting to climate change is critical to safeguarding the hard-earned progress in economic development sub-Saharan Africa has achieved in recent decades.
However, adaptation will be especially challenging given countries’ limited capacity and financial resources.
The priority then should be on making progress in select, critical areas which could have an outsized impact in reducing the chances of a family becoming food insecure when faced with shocks from climate change or epidemics.
For instance, progress in finance, telecoms, housing, and health care can reduce a family’s chance of facing food shortages by 30 percent:
Higher incomes (from diverse sources), and access to finance would help households buy food even when prices rise, allow them to invest in resilience ahead of a shock, and better cope afterwards.
Access to mobile phone networks enables people to benefit from early warning systems and gives farmers information on food prices and weather—just a single text or voice message, could help them decide when to plant or irrigate.
Better-built homes and farm buildings would protect people and food storage from climate shocks.
Combined with good sanitation and drainage systems, they would also preserve people’s earning capacity by preventing injuries, and the spread of disease, while ensuring safe drinking water.
Improved health care helps people return to work quickly after a shock; and, along with education, raises their income potential and helps inform their decisions.
Social assistance also has a major impact as it is critical in compensating people for lost income and purchasing power after a shock hits.
Insurance and disaster risk financing can be critical too, but the success of these programs in sub-Saharan Africa often relies on government subsidies and improvements in financial literacy.
Concentrating adaptation strategies in sub-Saharan Africa on policies that have outsized impacts, including on food security, will help reduce their costs.
Implementation of these strategies will be expensive—$30–50 billion (2–3 percent of regional GDP) each year over the next decade, according to many experts.
But investment now will be far less costly than the price of frequent disaster relief in the future, both for lives and livelihoods.
Our analysis finds that savings from reduced post-disaster spending could be many times the cost of upfront investment in building resilience and coping mechanisms.
Securing sources of financing is especially challenging against the background of the pandemic and rising global risk aversion.
But by stepping up financial support for adaptation to climate change in sub-Saharan Africa, development partners can make a tremendous difference in helping Africans put food on the table and recover from the pandemic.
A new study raises significant doubts about whether at-home rapid antigen tests can detect the Omicron variant before infected people can transmit the virus to others.
The study looks at 30 people from settings including Broadway theaters and offices in New York and San Francisco where some workers were not only being tested daily but were, because of rules at their workplaces, receiving both the antigen tests and a daily test that used the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, which is believed to be more reliable.

On days 0 and 1 following a positive PCR test, all of the antigen tests used produced false-negative results, even though in 28 of the 30 cases, levels of virus detected by the PCR test were high enough to infect other people.
In four cases, researchers were able to confirm that infected people transmitted the virus to others during the period before they had a positive result on the rapid antigen test.
“I think that with every new variant that comes, scientists have to question whether the things that were previously true are still true,” said Blythe Adamson, the lead author of the paper and the principal epidemiologist at Infectious Economics in New York.
“This one has a different way it travels, a different mechanism of action of symptoms, it has different windows of transmission.”
Adamson, who is also an employee of Flatiron Health, an affiliate of Roche, said that it was also possible there were more cases of transmission than the authors were able to confirm.

“It’s absolutely likely there were many more than four transmissions,” Adamson said.
“We named four because there were four that were confirmed through contact tracing and epidemiology investigation.
There were likely many more.”
The study included both the Abbott BinaxNOW and Quidel QuickVue rapid antigen tests, both of which are authorized by the Food and Drug Administration.
The results were published in a preprint, meaning they have not yet been reviewed by outside researchers.
A chart from the study shows significant false negatives in the early days after infection.

The results mean that rapid tests — both Abbott BinaxNOW and Quidel QuickVue — aren’t catching people during their first couple days of infection.
“We know that PCR tests are more sensitive than antigen tests — this is not new information,” Abbott Laboratories said in a statement.
“We also know that PCR tests are so sensitive that they do not indicate infectiousness and thus are not a practical tool for keeping the workforce and economy moving.”
Despite its small size, the results in the study are remarkably consistent.
Not a single rapid antigen test detected the virus until nearly two days after the initial positive PCR result.
Additionally, the cases of infection from people who had received false negative results could raise alarm bells.
Daniel Larremore, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Colorado Boulder who has studied Covid testing, said the results show rapid tests are not catching cases during the first days of infection.
Meanwhile, people are facing hour-long lines for PCR tests and multiple-day waits for results.
“[The] results strongly suggest that we will be unable to effectively test our way out of the current surge, even if we each had a week’s supply of rapid tests on the counter,” Larremore said.
He was not involved with this study.
Other data from the group indicate that viral loads peaked in saliva one to two days before they peaked in tests taken from nasal swabs, adding to evidence that swabs taken from the mouth or throat may detect the SARS-CoV-2 that causes Covid better than the nasal swabs used for many PCR and antigen tests.
“The major unknown is what it has been for weeks now: Are the [rapid antigen tests] inherently less able to detect Omicron, or is there less Omicron to detect on nasal swabs?”
asked John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College.
He noted that a paper from South Africa had also shown that there was more virus in saliva than in the nose.
“Does it replicate more in the throat/mouth and hence accumulates in saliva, more than it does in the nose and is present on nasal swabs?”
Moore asked.
“Remember that Omicron infections are not generally causing loss of smell, which happens when the virus damages nasal tissue and the nerves within the tissues.
Is that another indicator of less replication in the nose?”
At this point, researchers see riddles, not solutions.
However, many emphasize, this does not mean that rapid antigen tests are not useful.
The tests also detected the virus in every case – it just took longer than with PCR.
So while the tests may not work as an early warning, a positive test result at home does likely mean that the person taking the test has Covid-19.
Anne Wyllie, a researcher at the Yale School of Public Health and a co-author on the paper, said that the reports she is seeing from the general public on social media also raise her level of concern.
“If the general public is seeing this and reporting on it, you know, this is also a lot of evidence for me,” Wyllie said.
“Like they’re actually seeing it.
This is a lot more widespread than just this one outbreak that we were observing.”
During the pandemic, Adamson and Infectious Economics became consultants to many Broadway productions that were trying to keep their staffs safe from Covid.
The risk to audiences was relatively easy to control, but cast and crew members worked in cramped quarters where lots of safety precautions, including vaccination, masking, and the use of rapid tests were all necessary to keep people safe.
She said that as soon as Omicron hit, there were anecdotes about rapid antigen tests remaining negative until days after the infected people had already developed symptoms.
She said she started to feel anxiety about whether precautions to keep cast members safe would be enough.
Since then, numerous Broadway shows, including “Waitress” and “Jagged Little Pill,” have announced Covid-related closures.
With the virus “not going away any time soon,” countries must bolster testing and surveillance and ensure that vaccines get to where they are needed the most
Washington D.C., 18 May 2022 (PAHO) –
As cases of COVID-19 rise sharply throughout the region – by 27.2% over the past week – the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Director, Carissa F. Etienne, has called on countries to take action to increase surveillance, public health measures and vaccination, and to make sure that health systems are prepared to cope with a potential influx of COVID-19 patients.
“Last week, our region reported more than 918,000 cases,” the Director said in a media briefing today.
“COVID-19 hospitalizations increased in 18 countries, and admissions to Intensive Care Units rose in 13 countries and territories.”
Following a period of lower transmission, the PAHO Director highlighted that many countries have abandoned public health measures such as mask-wearing and social distancing.
But with only 14 of the 51 countries and territories in the Americas reaching the World Health Organization (WHO) goal of 70% vaccination coverage, far too many people remain unprotected.
In some countries, vaccination coverage is particularly low among those at risk of severe disease, including the elderly, pregnant women, and people with preexisting conditions, she noted.
“Each country is only as protected as the most vulnerable in their population,” Dr. Etienne said.
“It is time to take stock of these numbers and act.
COVID-19 is again on the rise in the Americas.”
Despite having built “incredible networks for COVID testing and genomic surveillance” over the past two years, the PAHO Director said that testing rates have steadily declined since January.
“We must keep our eyes on the virus,” she said, calling on countries to maintain and strengthen testing infrastructure and to ensure that in places where self-tests are available, results are reported to health authorities.
Countries must also maintain investments in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and hospital capacity so that services can be quickly scaled-up to meet a potential surge in new infections, she added.
The PAHO Director called on countries to be ready to reinstate public health measures in areas where cases spike, and to ensure that the most vulnerable groups are protected, particularly now that vaccine supplies are no longer a barrier.
“We have sufficient doses to cover those most at risk, and we have an obligation to do so,” she said.
Turning to the COVID-19 situation in the region, the Director noted that more than half of the new infections were reported in North America, where cases have been climbing for seven weeks, driven by a surge in the United States.
In Central America, COVID-19 cases have increased by 80%, and cases have also spiked in countries across South America.
In the Caribbean, new infections have been on the rise for five consecutive weeks, with a 9.3% increase in cases and a 49% increase in deaths.
As the world’s highest health authorities meet next week for the World Health Assembly in Geneva to determine the global priorities for public health, the PAHO Director said that health emergencies will remain top of the agenda.
“We must take what we learned from past emergencies to shape a future where our health systems and leadership are better prepared to face the next challenge,” she said.
“The better prepared our health systems are, the less lives we lose and the stronger and more resilient our societies become.”
What GAO Found
The U.S. Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS), within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), reported 345 cases of COVID-19 among employees, as of January 31, 2021.
Federal Air Marshal Service's Reported Cases of COVID-19, as of January 31, 2021
Note: Cases included in the figure were confirmed with a positive COVID-19 test and reported to the Federal Air Marshal Service by the employee.
To protect air marshals from COVID-19, FAMS provided supplies like N95 masks and implemented new telework and leave policies.
FAMS also created protocols for responding to employees with COVID-19, but has not consistently documented their implementation.
By doing so, FAMS could better ensure it is taking the required steps to protect employees and the flying public.
GAO also found FAMS does not routinely facilitate employee access to COVID-19 testing.
FAMS recommends employees seek testing through their medical provider or local public health officials, but air marshals in all three field offices GAO met with either noted barriers to testing or benefits to improved access to tests.
In January 2021, FAMS employees became eligible for COVID-19 vaccinations, but Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance says testing continues to be important even as vaccinations become available.
By facilitating access to testing, FAMS could better ensure employee health and continued operations.
Starting in February 2020, FAMS adjusted the number and types of flights air marshals covered.
In April 2020, amidst a decline in U.S. carrier flights, the number of flights FAMS covered declined by 90 percent compared to average monthly flights pre-pandemic.
By June 2020, FAMS had resumed pre-pandemic flight levels.
From April through August 2020, FAMS made operational changes to increase its flight coverage that also resulted in FAMS covering different types of flights, compared to those it covered prior to the pandemic.
For example, due to travel restrictions, FAMS stopped covering most international flights but increased coverage of other types of flights.
Starting in April 2020, FAMS also increased air marshals' non-flight work, such as providing a security presence at airports and national events.
Why GAO Did This Study
In the U.S. there have been over 29 million cumulative reported cases of COVID-19 and about 524,000 reported deaths, as of March 23, 2021.
Public health officials have recommended social distancing and other steps to reduce the spread of the disease, but air marshals often work on planes where they cannot fully adopt these measures.
The CARES Act included a provision for GAO to conduct monitoring and oversight of the federal government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
This report examines (1) how many air marshals have been diagnosed with COVID-19; (2) FAMS's steps to protect air marshals' health; and (3) how FAMS adapted its operations during the pandemic.
GAO analyzed FAMS data on COVID-19 cases among employees, reviewed agency guidance, analyzed FAMS flight operations reports, and interviewed FAMS leadership as well as air marshals at a non-generalizable sample of three field offices selected for variation in number of COVID-19 cases, among other things.
This is a public version of a sensitive report that GAO issued in May 2021.
Information that DHS deemed sensitive has been omitted.
As more people get vaccinated, a surprise discovery has been that the vaccines seem to provide relief for some patients with what’s being called “long COVID” (when symptoms linger for weeks or even months).
Persistent and unpredictable, the symptoms of long COVID can include chronic cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, memory and sleep problems, and in the most severe cases, even organ damage.
Doctors don’t know a lot about what causes long-term COVID-19 symptoms, and there are many questions still to be answered about the reported improvements seen with the vaccines: Why might the vaccine help some people?
Are some vaccines better at this than others?
Could a tool designed for prevention also serve as a treatment?
Akiko Iwasaki, PhD, professor of immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine, and a major contributor to the existing body of COVID-19 research, is among those now focused on generating hard data on vaccinated "long-haulers" to help answer these questions.
She is currently working with other scientists to launch what she predicts will be a large collaborative study at Yale.
Key members include Harlan Krumholz, MD; Wade Schulz, MD, PhD; Aaron Ring, MD, PhD; and Charles Dela Cruz, MD, PhD.
They will be recruiting people with long-term symptoms who have not been vaccinated, so they can collect blood and saliva samples.
The researchers will then follow up to collect additional samples after vaccination, so they can compare the immune responses in these long-haulers and correlate them with their symptom changes.
There are a number of questions to be answered, Iwasaki says.

Even though COVID-19 continues with its variants, medical experts are hopeful the virus is becoming less deadly and disrupting.
In other words, we are learning to live with it.
As a result, it should not be surprising there is an increasing number of studies being released about how we coped with COVID-19, and what we can learn if we confront another pandemic.
One way to accomplish this is to compare the outcomes of states during COVID-19 on a number of important measures.
One recent study was authored by three economists and released by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).
The NBER is not a national agency.
It is a non-partisan, non-profit research organization founded in 1920.
It is one of the most prestigious economic “think-tanks” in the country.
Hence, when the NBER releases a study, I pay attention.
Although there were many policies, programs and funding that came from the federal government to address the pandemic, our federal system allowed the 50 states and Washington, D.C. to customize some of their own policies, including masking, shutdowns, the operation of schools and the availability of vaccines.
Therefore, there were 51 (50 states plus Washington, D.C.) different localities for the authors to compare for their outcomes in dealing with COVID-19.
The authors focused on three categories of results: the economy, education and deaths.
For the economy, the authors used two measures: the total months of unemployment per worker in the state from April 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic through the end of 2021, and the depth of the recession caused by the pandemic.
The pandemic’s impact on education was measured by the percentage of public education in each state that took place in-person at schools rather than remotely.
This measure was used because many experts and parents have argued that remote learning for children during COVID-19 was not as beneficial for students’ educational outcomes as in-person learning.
For deaths, the death rate per capita during the previous two COVID-19 years was used, but only after adjusting the numbers for age and for health factors, such as the prevalence of diabetes and obesity in the state.
So, what did the study find, particularly for North Carolina?
On the two economic measures, North Carolina ranked 17th on the unemployment measure and 19th for the depth of the COVID-19 recession, where a higher ranking means a better performance.
Translated, the results mean that among the 51 states plus Washington, D.C., North Carolina had the 17th lowest total number of unemployment months per worker and the 19th mildest COVID-19 recession.
Montana had the best performance on unemployment and South Dakota had the least severe recession.
At the other end of the spectrum, New Jersey had the worst performance on unemployment and Connecticut had the deepest recession.
North Carolina’s ranking on in-person teaching of students was not as impressive.
The state ranked 34th, meaning 33 other states had a higher percentage of students receiving in-person instruction during the pandemic.
Wyoming had the highest percentage of in-person instruction, whereas Washington, D.C. had the lowest percentage.
North Carolina’s best ranking was on age and medical-adjusted COVID-19-related deaths per capita, where the state ranked 7th, meaning only six states had lower adjusted COVID-19 deaths per capita.
The best performing state on deaths was Hawaii, while the worst performing state was Arizona.
The authors also combined the individual rankings for each measure into a single overall ranking.
North Carolina’s overall ranking was 13th, meaning the state had the 13th best performance during the pandemic among the fifty states and Washington, D.C. using all the metrics developed by the authors.
Utah ranked first on the combined ranking, and New Jersey came in last.
With 51 localities, North Carolina’s placement of number 13 puts the state in the top 25%.
Among North Carolina’s immediate neighbors, only South Carolina placed higher at number 12.
Georgia ranked 19th, Tennessee was at the 24th position and Virginia placed 36th.
As the economy moves forward, rankings of how states performed during the pandemic may become very important.
The rankings could become a major factor in the location decisions of both businesses and households.
It will take years – possibly even decades – for the memories of the COVID-19 pandemic to recede.
Households and businesses will be motivated to locate in states that coped well during the pandemic compared to other states.
The study published by the NBER strongly suggests North Carolina is in the “coping-well” category.
Economists agree the future economy will go through major changes in what businesses do, how people work, and how and where people live.
Being in a state that has navigated the pandemic better than most other states should give that state an advantage in dealing with these changes.
Is North Carolina such a state?
You decide.

Compared to unvaccinated women, women vaccinated for COVID-19 have a slightly higher risk of a heavier period after vaccination, suggests a study funded by the National Institutes of Health.
However, flow returns to normal in the next menstrual period.
The study was led by Blair G. Darney, Ph.D., and Alison Edelman, M.D., of Oregon Health & Science University, and colleagues at other institutions.
It appears in BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.
Funding was provided by NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and Office of Research on Women’s Health as part of $1.67 million awarded to five institutions to explore potential links between COVID-19 vaccination and menstrual changes.
Background
Previous research by the authors found a link between COVID-19 vaccination and a temporary increase in menstrual cycle length, but no change in the duration of the menstrual period (bleeding).
Researchers analyzed de-identified menstrual cycle data from the fertility tracking app, Natural Cycles.
App users reported daily bleeding quantity as “spotting”, “light”, “medium”, or “heavy.”
The authors categorized variations in the monthly cycle as “less bleeding,” “no change,” or “more bleeding.”
The dataset included mainly individuals from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Europe.
A total of 9,555 people contributed data (7,401 vaccinated, 2,154 unvaccinated).
Results
About two thirds reported no change in the number of heavy bleeding days regardless of vaccination status.
There were no significant differences in the number of heavy bleeding days between those who were vaccinated and unvaccinated.
However, a larger proportion of vaccinated individuals reported an increase in total bleeding quantity: 38.4% vs. 34.5%.
This translated to roughly 40 people per 1,000 experiencing more total bleeding after the first vaccine dose.
Differences between the groups resolved in the next cycle.
Significance
The authors concluded their findings continue to validate experiences shared by the public and provide reassurance that if changes in flow occur with vaccination, they are likely to be small and temporary.

Maggie Anthony didn’t have much time to deliberate before getting her COVID-19 vaccine.
A labor and delivery nurse at Cambridge Hospital in Massachusetts, she suddenly heard from her manager that shots would be available the next day.
But with an 8-month-old breastfeeding baby at home, she wasn’t sure whether to accept.
Those who are pregnant and lactating haven’t been included in clinical trials for the COVID vaccines, so there’s no data on the vaccines’ safety for these groups.
At first, Anthony thought she would decline.
She knew that in the United Kingdom, the National Health Service had said people who are pregnant and breastfeeding shouldn’t be vaccinated.
The Food and Drug Administration simply advises, “If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, discuss your options with your healthcare provider.”
But Anthony had another factor to consider: She regularly cares for COVID-positive women.
“During labor, in the operating room, in their faces — there is no distance,” she said.
“So I know that I am definitely exposed.”
When the day came, she got her shot.
What helped make up her mind, Anthony said, was to consider pregnancy and breastfeeding separately.
In her view, it was “kind of impossible to imagine a way” in which the fragile mRNA in the vaccine could reach or affect her nursing baby.
If she were still pregnant, with a baby sharing her blood through her placenta, she would have felt more nervous.
“It’s certainly a completely different scenario in my mind,” she said.
Government guidelines and news headlines alike have grouped those who are breastfeeding and pregnant together when talking about COVID vaccine safety.
But as people try to make their own decisions without safety data, it might help to acknowledge that getting vaccinated during pregnancy and lactation carry different theoretical risks — and potential benefits.
Christina Chambers, a perinatal epidemiologist and professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Diego, said it’s never a good idea to lump together pregnancy and breastfeeding when asking whether something is harmful.
Some drugs that are risky in pregnancy are also avoided by people who are breastfeeding, even when they’re perfectly safe for a nursing baby.
READ MORE: Does breastfeeding prevent moms’ heart disease and strokes?
Chambers said vaccines in general, especially those like the COVID vaccines that contain no live virus, are unlikely to harm a fetus or a nursing baby.
“But they do raise some kind of different issues” in those who are pregnant or breastfeeding, she added.
Some of those issues pertain to the way vaccines work in general — by causing an immune response.
Could triggering an immune response during the first weeks of pregnancy increase the risk of miscarriage?
If they have an anaphylactic reaction or a high fever in response to the shot, could it affect the baby in any way?
These are the kinds of questions that researchers will try to answer in future clinical trials.
Yet with breastfeeding, those concerns don’t apply.
The main question is whether a dangerous amount of a substance gets filtered into a mother’s milk.
For most drugs, Chambers said, “There’s so little that gets to the baby that there’s really very little theoretical risk.”
Even if a drug or vaccine does end up in breastmilk, its journey into the baby isn’t done.
“Anything that goes through breastmilk also then has to go through a gut,” said Helen Hare, a junior doctor in acute medicine in Edinburgh, Scotland.
Hare co-authored a BMJ opinion piece called “Healthcare workers who breastfeed should be offered the COVID-19 vaccine.”
The delicate mRNA molecules in the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, if they made it into the milk, would next land in a baby’s stomach acid.
“If this vaccine worked by the oral route, we would not be having injections,” Hare said.
The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine made the same point in a Dec. 14 statement.
“During lactation, it is unlikely that the vaccine lipid would enter the blood stream and reach breast tissue,” the authors wrote.
“If it does, it is even less likely that either the intact nanoparticle or mRNA transfer into milk.
In the unlikely event that mRNA is present in milk, it would be expected to be digested by the child and would be unlikely to have any biological effects.”
With no clinical trial data on the issue, it’s impossible for any organization or expert to say with absolute certainty that there are no risks.
But even the World Health Organization suggests a less cautious approach in breastfeeding than in pregnancy.
For pregnant people, the WHO recommends not getting the Pfizer vaccine “unless the benefit of vaccinating a pregnant woman outweighs the potential vaccine risks,” such as for health care workers at high risk of exposure.
But since the vaccine is “biologically and clinically unlikely to pose a risk to the breastfeeding child,” those who are lactating should be offered their shots just like anyone else.
While the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine says the vaccines pose “little plausible risk” for a child who is nursing, it also says there is a “biologically plausible benefit.”
After the vaccine triggers the mother’s immune system to make antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, those molecules may pass into the breastmilk.
Babies routinely get temporary disease protection from their mothers in this way.
Researchers have already found COVID antibodies in the breastmilk of previously infected women, though they don’t know yet how much protection these antibodies give babies.
READ MORE: People with type 1 diabetes have a higher risk of dying from COVID-19.
Why are they lower on CDC’s vaccine priority list?
At UCSD, Chambers is working on studies of how COVID infection, and vaccines, affect mothers and babies during pregnancy and beyond.
Women are also supplying milk samples that researchers will test for antibodies.
(In an earlier paper, Chambers and co-authors found no live virus in the breastmilk of infected women.)
Antibodies may also pass to the fetus of a person who’s vaccinated while pregnant, Chambers said.
During the first round of COVID vaccinations in the U.K., women didn’t have the chance to weigh those factors for themselves.
If they were pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant, they couldn’t get the shot.
In their opinion piece, Hare and co-author Kate Womersley, an academic junior doctor in Edinburgh and research associate at the George Institute for Global Health, wrote that “no plausible biological mechanism for how an inactivated, recombinant vaccine would cause harm to a breastfed baby has been proposed.”
Yet the U.K. policy was forcing frontline health care workers into an impossible choice: They could forgo vaccination, wean their children before they were ready, or lie.
Then on Dec. 30, government press releases about the authorization of a second vaccine in the U.K. mentioned — almost in passing — that the guidelines had changed.
Those who are breastfeeding or pregnant were no longer ineligible for a shot.
Womersley said it’s “disappointing” that there wasn’t a clearer announcement about the new guidelines.
She and Hare have heard anecdotally of women being refused vaccines even after the change.
Unclear communication about the vaccines does a disservice to women, Womersley said, by undermining public confidence.
Hare agreed that there should be better communication about the vaccines, including acknowledging that pregnancy and breastfeeding are two different things.
“I think it helps engender faith in the guidelines that the actual situation’s being considered,” she said.
Those who are pregnant and breastfeeding also have different risk factors from COVID itself to consider, Womersley added — COVID is thought to be especially risky in pregnancy.
“We should tailor the conversation differently for breastfeeding and pregnancy because the benefits and risks are different,” she said.
“I don’t think it helps either group to lump them together like this,” Womersley said.
“The only thing that actually unifies those two groups is that they are routinely discriminated against and excluded from trials.”

Local and federal authorities spent months investigating a warehouse in Fresno County, California, that they suspect was home to an illegal, unlicensed laboratory full of lab mice, medical waste and hazardous materials.
The Fresno County Public Health Department has been "evaluating and assessing the activities of an unlicensed laboratory" in Reedley, the health department's assistant director, Joe Prado, said in a statement Thursday.
All of the biological agents were destroyed by July 7 following a legal abatement process by the agency.
"The evaluation required coordination and collaboration with multiple federal and state agencies to determine and classify biological and chemical contents onsite, in addition to assessing jurisdictional authority under this unique situation," Prado said.

According to court documents, city officials inspected the location at 850 I St. on March 3 for building violations and found various chemicals being stored.
On March 16, an inspection by county public health officials allegedly turned up medical devices thought to have been developed on-site, such as Covid and pregnancy tests.
"Certain rooms of the warehouse were found to contain several vessels of liquid and various apparatus," court documents said.
"Fresno County Public Health staff also observed blood, tissue and other bodily fluid samples and serums; and thousands of vials of unlabeled fluids and suspected biological material.
"
Hundreds of mice at the warehouse were kept in inhumane conditions, court documents said.
The city took possession of the animals in April, euthanizing 773 of them; more than 175 were found dead.
Furniture, chemicals and devices were improperly stored.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tested the substances and detected at least 20 potentially infectious agents, including coronavirus, HIV, hepatitis and herpes, according to a Health and Human Services letter dated June 6.
An investigation found the tenant was Prestige BioTech, a company registered in Nevada and unlicensed for business in California.
City officials spoke with Xiuquin Yao, who was identified as the company president, through emails included in the court documents.
Yao told officials that Prestige BioTech moved assets belonging to a defunct company, Universal Meditech Inc., to the Reedley warehouse from Fresno after UMI went under.
Prestige Biotech was a creditor to UMI and identified as its successor, according to court documents.
Officials were unable to get any California-based address for either company except for the previous Fresno location from which UMI had been evicted.
"The other addresses provided for identified authorized agents were either empty offices or addresses in China that could not be verified," court documents said.
Prestige BioTech is accused of failing to comply with orders, including providing a plan for biological abatement and disposal of the materials.
Emails sent to Yao and Prestige BioTech requesting comment were not immediately answered Thursday.
Prado told NBC affiliate KSEE of Fresno that those associated with Prestige BioTech were not forthcoming with information.
Court documents say they failed to provide any licensing or permit that allows experimentation or other laboratory activity.
Reedley City Manager Nicole Zieba told KSEE that officials have cleared the area of hazardous materials but are still working to empty the warehouse.
"Some of our federal partners still have active investigations going.
I can only speak to the building side of it,” Zieba said.
CNN —
There’s a new kind of Covid-19 shot coming to a pharmacy or clinic near you.
The US Food and Drug Administration and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signed off on updated boosters that target the original strain of the coronavirus as well as the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5.
The hope is that these shots will improve protection against the currently circulating viruses that cause Covid-19.
Here’s everything you need to know about the new bivalent boosters and who can get them.
How are these new bivalent vaccines different?
The new bivalent vaccines carry instructions to help our cells make defenses against two strains of the virus that causes Covid-19.
The shots direct cells to make antibodies that bind to certain parts of the spike proteins from both the original strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants, which share an identical spike.
BA.4 and BA.5 are the dominant variants in the United States, where there’s an average of 91,000 new infections each day.
“These are vaccines that are made, manufactured and delivered identically to the Covid mRNA vaccines that most of us have already gotten,” said Dr. Gregory Poland, who leads the vaccine research group at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
“In a sense, you’ve just changed the blueprints.”
Having twice the blueprints doesn’t mean you’re getting twice the dose of active ingredients, though.
“The total mRNA content – the business part of the vaccine – that leads to the immune response is the same amount,” said Dr. William Gruber, senior vice president of vaccine research and development at Pfizer, which makes one of the updated vaccines.
Pfizer’s booster is a 30-microgram dose that contains 15 micrograms of mRNA against the ancestral strain and 15 micrograms against the BA.4 and BA.5 variants.
It is authorized for people as young as 12.
Moderna’s bivalent booster is a 50-microgram dose, with 25 micrograms of mRNA designed to fight the ancestral strain of the coronavirus and 25 micrograms of mRNA designed to fight the BA.4 and BA.5 variants.
It’s authorized for people 18 and older.
The earlier mRNA shots are still the first two shots a person will get, but they’re no longer authorized for use as boosters in people age 12 and older.
Millions of vaccines are now shipping to tens of thousands of sites across the country.
These include community health centers, health departments and pharmacies.
CVS and Walgreens have started offering the shots.
Both chains are scheduling appointments online, and say more slots will be added as they get shipments of the vaccines.
The Biden administration expects appointment availability to ramp up over the first several days, with broad availability in a few weeks.
People will be able to find locations at Vaccines.gov.
“You’ll start seeing some places start giving some shots in arms over the weekend, but very relatively few because [of the] Labor Day weekend.
And my expectation is over next week, or certainly over the next 10 days, you’re going to start seeing these bivalent vaccines become widely available across the country,” Dr. Ashish Jha, who leads the White House Covid-19 Response Team, told CNN.
As with past Covid-19 vaccines, these shots will be available free of charge.
But they may be some of the last Covid-19 freebies from the government, which has said it’s going to start commercializing treatments and vaccines this fall.
Americans ages 12 and older are recommended get the new boosters as long as they’ve already had their primary series of vaccines.
Experts say everyone needs one as protection from both vaccination and infection wanes considerably over time and in all age groups.
“I do believe there will be benefit, essentially for everyone, with clearly more benefit for the elderly and those who have underlying conditions,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on CNN on Friday.
Adults age 18 and older can get either a Pfizer or Moderna shot.
Adolescents ages 12 and older can get an updated Pfizer shot.
You should wait two months after your last vaccine dose to get an updated booster.
For those who have recently recovered from a Covid-19 infection, the CDC recommends waiting at least until the illness has passed and a person is no longer contagious.
For best results, it may be better to delay a booster for at least three months after symptoms started.
Infection itself probably already acted like a booster; studies have shown that people have a relatively low risk of getting sick again for about three months after they recover.
You may not want to wait as long as three months if Covid-19 levels are already high in your community or if you are reduced immune function.
“Myself as an example, I was vaccinated, doubly boosted and infected, and I will be getting the updated BA.4/5 bivalent vaccine within three months of my having gotten infected, exactly the way the FDA has authorized and the CDC has recommended,” Fauci said.
US health officials have recommended that providers offer the seasonal flu vaccine and Covid-19 vaccines at the same visit if a patient is eligible for the vaccinations.
This upcoming fall and winter could host a high spread of flu and Covid-19, and administering both vaccinations at the same time has been found to be safe.
The government is also preparing to launch a campaign that will urge Americans to get their annual flu shot along with an updated Covid-19 booster.
One vaccine for which there are no data on administering it at the same time as others is the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine, according to the CDC’s guidance.
The agency recommends that people, particularly adolescent or young adult men, might consider waiting four weeks after receiving monkeypox vaccination before receiving a Moderna, Novavax or Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, “because of the observed risk” for myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, or pericarditis, inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart.
The CDC adds that monkeypox vaccination “should not be delayed” due to recently receiving a Moderna, Novavax or Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.
Children ages 5 through 11 can still be boosted with the older, single-strain vaccines.
Vaccine manufacturers are updating boosters for younger children now.
Pfizer said it’s retooling its shots for children ages to 5 through 11 and will ask the FDA for authorization of those updated boosters in early October.
It’s working with the FDA to update vaccines for children ages 6 months through 4 years.
Until those are ready, the best way to protect babies, toddlers and gradeschoolers is to get eligible family and friends an updated shot.
Yes, but that’s not all.
If a health condition or a medication has lowered your immune function, the CDC recommends a two-pronged approach to boost your protection against Covid-19 – vaccination and preventive treatment with a type of passive immunity called Evusheld.
Passive immunity is when antibodies are made in a lab and then given by injection or infusion to help people who can’t make enough of this protection on their own.
Evusheld can be taken every six months and is available for immunocompromised people ages 12 and up.
It requires a doctors prescription, but the treatment itself is free.
The CDC estimates 7 million people may be eligible to take Evusheld, but most haven’t gotten it because they don’t know about it.
If you need Evusheld, you should wait at least two weeks after getting a Covid-19 vaccine to take it.
But after a person has taken Evusheld, there’s no waiting period for getting an updated booster.
A recent review of adverse events after mRNA booster vaccinations in adults the United States found that side effects were less common after booster doses than after second doses of the vaccine, and most were mild.
About 1 in 8 adults reported a headache, fever or pain after a booster.
In children and teens, commonly reported side effects after boosters were pain at the site of the injection, fatigue, headache and muscle aches.
Very rarely, mRNA vaccines can cause myocarditis, or swelling in or around the heart.
After more than 80 million booster doses given in the United States, the government safety surveillance systems received 37 verifiable reports of myocarditis.
Most of these were in men.
The highest rates of myocarditis in adults were in younger men – ages 18 to 24.
For every million booster doses given to men this age, the CDC expects about that about will have myocarditis.
For adolescents, the rate is slightly higher but still extremely low: about 11 cases of myocarditis for every million doses.
Dr. Peter Marks, who directs the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said that to minimize this risk, officials are directing that the vaccines be given at least two months after a previous dose.
“It seems to be associated when they’re given closer to one another,” he said.
The evidence for these updated vaccines is a bit different than what was behind earlier versions.
These are the first Covid-19 vaccines authorized for use in people after being tested only in mice, following much the same process used each year when annual flu shots are updated.
The FDA allowed companies to submit data from animal tests in order to speed these shots to the public.
Studies in people are underway.
FDA’s Marks said he expects that it will be a month or two before data on humans is available.
Officials say urgency with these boosters is warranted going into the fall, when Covid-19 is still circulating at high levels and influenza is expected to make a return.
But some vaccine experts feel that animal studies don’t provide sufficient evidence for these vaccines at this stage in the pandemic.
“You’re asking people to get a new product for which there’s no data,” Dr. Paul Offit, who directs the vaccine education center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN.
“Mice data are not adequate to launch 100-plus-billion-dose effort.”
Offit says it makes sense to use data from animal studies for updates to annual flu vaccines because we’ve used those shots for decades, and we understand what biomarkers to look for when gauging whether they work.
These so-called correlates of protection are not as well understood for the Covid-19 vaccines.
It’s not just the shots that are different, Poland said.
At this point in the pandemic, our immune systems are, too.
Nearly all Americans have been infected with the coronavirus, vaccinated or both.
Some people have had four or five doses of vaccine.
“So if you say to me, ‘can you assure me that getting dose five or dose six of this new vaccine in the background of having received these previous doses is absolutely safe?’
I’d say ‘no, I can’t.’
We’re extrapolating.
And I think we ought to be clear about that,” Poland said.
FDA officials point out that animal studies weren’t the only data they reviewed to make their decision.
They considered two other lines of evidence.
The first is the vaccines’ track records.
The same basic vaccines have now been given to hundreds of millions of people around the world.
They have been shown to be extremely effective at preventing severe disease and death from Covid-19.
Risks associated with mRNA vaccination are very, very low.
The second line of evidence comes from bivalent vaccines that may soon be used in Europe and Canada.
Earlier this year, Pfizer and Moderna presented an independent panel of experts who advise the FDA with data on a bivalent vaccine designed to target the original strain of Omicron, BA.1.
That data showed that the vaccines boosted antibody responses and were well-tolerated.
Other countries have authorized these vaccines, but they will not be available in the US.
The BA.1 strain isn’t circulating any more, and the FDA asked the manufacturers to update their US shots to include BA.4 and BA.5 instead.
Some evidence suggests that the BA.4 and BA.5 strains generate a stronger immune response than BA.1, which is another reason officials wanted to include them in the updated shots.
FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said he understands that people may want to know more, but he’s confident that these vaccines are safe and effective.
“It’s fair for people to raise questions.
But this really is the best consensus that we have among the experts that this is the best way to go.
… It’s just painful to see people dying unnecessarily when there’s a free treatment that would prevent their death,” he said.
“I will be at the front of the line at the pharmacy getting my vaccination,” said Califf, who will turn 71 next month.
“I’m very confident about this.”
In the past, tests of variant-specific vaccines have had lackluster results.
It’s hard to know how effective these bivalent vaccines could be.
In a recent preprint study, published ahead of peer review, scientists tried to estimate this with a meta-analysis, or a study of studies.
The gathered estimates of antibody levels after booster doses against the ancestral strains, as well as against specific variants, and tried to use those levels to predict how well the shots would work.
They found that people got the biggest benefits from getting boosted, period.
A booster against the ancestral strain increased neutralizing antibodies 11-fold.
The scientists estimated that would increase a person’s protection against symptomatic infection over the next six months from 50% to 86.5%.
Variant-specific boosters worked a little better, but the difference wasn’t dramatic.
After those shots, protection against symptomatic infection over the next six months rose to 90.2%, just a 4.6% increase.
The Covid-19 vaccines were due for an update.
As the coronavirus has been circulating, it has changed a lot.
These changes have helped it slip past the antibodies that we made against older versions of the virus and older versions of the vaccine.
As a result, it has gotten better at causing reinfections and breakthrough infections.
The hope is that giving people updated vaccines will improve their ability to fight off the infection and shore up protection against severe disease that causes hospitalization or death.
There is also some hope that updated boosters may slow the spread of the virus – and thus the speed at which vaccine-busting variants appear.

The coronavirus is changing at blistering speed.
In a meeting with FDA vaccine advisers last June, Trevor Bedford, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Reserach Center in Seattle, compared the speed of evolution of the viruses that cause Covid-19 to that of the viruses that cause influenza.
Among the faster influenza viruses, he said, it takes about three years for a new strain to emerge and start showing up in testing in significant numbers.
Among the variants of the virus that causes Covid-19, the Delta variant pulled off this feat in a year.
Omicron did it in three to four months.
So there is genuine concern that without something to slow transmission of the infection, we’ll be forever stuck in catchup mode, waiting for faster and potentially more dangerous variants to emerge.
WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, Ohio - Wright-Patterson Air Force Base public health officials recommend continuing to be vigilant in following all approved Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention and Ohio Department of Health prevention measures for COVID-19.
“WPAFB personnel should be a beacon in the community and set an example for best behavior,” said Capt. Stephanie Croyle, Public Health officer.
“We are asking that you ask yourself, ‘Is there anything I could have done better today to slow the spread?’”
The following prevention measures are still in effect:
Wear face masks in public or indoors and in close proximity with co-workers or with all other people who don’t live under your roof.
Maximize teleworking in work centers on base.
Maintain a physical distance of 6 feet or more from other people when in public or in work centers.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after you have been in a public place and before eating; or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Do not gather in groups more than 10 people, and only do this when it is essential.
Avoid socializing in-person with others not in your household.
For group gathers, check current base guidelines.
Avoid socializing in-person with others not in your household.
Be alert for symptoms.
Watch for fever, much more common is loss of taste/smell and muscle aches, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of COVID-19.
Do not go into your work center or public spaces if you are not feeling well.
Even if you feel your symptoms are mild, contact a health-care provider for further instruction.
Many healthy individuals have very mild symptoms.
Avoid close contact
Inside your home: Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
A negative test does not guarantee the person doesn’t have COVID-19
Outside your home: Put 6 feet of distance between yourself and people who don’t live in your household.
Best to only interact with others if essential outdoors.
Remember that some people with-out symptoms may be able to spread virus.
Keeping distance from others is especially important for people who are at higher risk of get-ting very sick.

Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily.
This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
Follow healthcare and public health professional advice.
For example, if you are identified as a close con-tact, you must quarantine and not go out into the community.
You cannot test out of quarantine, meaning that a negative test does not shorten your quarantine time.
For close contacts, quarantine is 14 days following the last con-tact with the COVID+ person.

Preclinical tests at UAB last year showed potent systemic and mucosal immune responses in mice after a single intranasal dose.
The vaccine candidate was developed by Maryland-based Altimmune Inc.
Editor's Note: The information published in this story is accurate at the time of publication.
Always refer to uab.edu/uabunited for UAB's current guidelines and recommendations relating to COVID-19.
Update: See Altimmune for a June 29, 2021 press release on its “disappointing” news about the Phase 1 clinical trial of the vaccine candidate.
Preclinical testing of the vaccine candidate at UAB in 2020.
(Photography: Lexi Coon)The Altimmune Inc. vaccine candidate that was tested preclinically at the University of Alabama at Birmingham last year is expected to start patient enrollment for its Phase 1 clinical trial next week.
Maryland-based biopharmaceutical company Altimmune announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration has cleared the company’s Investigational New Drug application for its Phase 1 clinical trial of AdCOVID, a novel, single-dose, intranasal COVID-19 vaccine candidate.
The UAB preclinical testing of AdCOVID last spring and summer was led by Fran Lund, Ph.D., chair of the UAB Department of Microbiology, and it included 23 other researchers from six UAB labs in the UAB School of Medicine — all working under strict COVID-19 safety protocols that required masking and social distancing.
The UAB researchers found potent serum neutralizing antibody responses, T cell responses and a robust induction in mucosal immunity in mice following a single intranasal dose of AdCOVID.
The vaccine candidate has tantalizing promises, according to Altimmune.
No need of refrigeration.
Simple one-dose administration by a spray into the nose.
The power to elicit mucosal immunity at the linings of the nose and lungs would protect not only against infection but also against transmission.
Existing intramuscular COVID-19 vaccines are not known to elicit this kind of immunity.
Altimmune says it expects that these simple and convenient handling requirements, together with the potential ability to block SARS-CoV-2 transmission, could position AdCOVID as a leading intranasal COVID-19 vaccine.
“We believe deployment of intranasal vaccines like AdCOVID will be essential to a successful global response to the pandemic,” said Vipin K. Garg, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Altimmune.
“Developing vaccines that can effectively prevent transmission is a growing imperative to block the spread of disease and combat the emergence of new variants.”
Fran Lund, Ph.D. (Photography: Steve Wood)Altimmune’s Phase 1 clinical trial will evaluate safety and immunogenicity of AdCOVID in up to 180 healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55.
AdCOVID will be administered as a nasal spray at one of three dose levels.
Altimmune will look primarily for safety and tolerability, but it will also measure immunogenicity of AdCOVID by serum IgG binding and neutralizing antibody titers, mucosal IgA antibody from nasal samples and T cell responses.
Lund said of last year’s preclinical testing, “In animals, intranasal vaccination initiated immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the nose and lungs, which are the sites that are first infected by the virus.
“If the vaccine works similarly in humans, then we hope that vaccination via the intranasal route might not only protect the vaccinated person from serious illness but also help minimize virus transmission within the community.
We look forward to seeing the first data from the human studies.”
At UAB, Lund holds the Charles H. McCauley Chair of Microbiology.
Conflict, insecurity, COVID-19 and deteriorating economic conditions are leading to a rise in trafficking of children, forced labour and forced recruitment by armed groups in Mali, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency is warning today.
More cases of child recruitment were documented in the first half of this year (230 cases) compared to the whole of 2019 (215 cases), according to a report released by the UNHCR-led Global Protection Cluster, a network of UN agencies and NGOs providing protection to people affected by humanitarian crises.
Armed groups are also trafficking children for labour in gold mines, using profits to enrich combatants, fuel the arms trade and finance the violence.
Extortionate “taxes” are also imposed on adults operating in those gold mines.
As schools remain closed due to conflict, insecurity, COVID-19 or teachers’ strikes –children are also pushed towards informal gold mines, particularly in Gao and Kidal where many areas are controlled by armed groups.
Rapid child protection assessments found an estimated 6,000 children, disproportionately boys, working across eight mine sites in the country.
They are exposed to the worst forms of child labour, economic exploitation, and physical, sexual and psychological abuse.
Some children arrived on the site on “credit” – whereby a third-party finances their transport and food.
Others reported having worked days without being paid.
The children are forced to work for an unspecified time until they pay off recruitment and travel “debt”.
“As a result of conflict and socio-economic deterioration worsened by the pandemic, we are seeing some of the most egregious human rights violations in the Sahel,” said UNHCR’s Assistant High Commissioner for Protection, Gillian Triggs.
“Children are being forced to fight by armed groups, trafficked, raped, sold, forced into sexual or domestic servitude, or married off.
Many more children are at risk in the Sahel, a region which is becoming the fastest-growing humanitarian crisis in the world.”
Victims are Malian as well as refugees, asylum seekers or migrants.
Reports of communities of women and girls being abducted, sexually assaulted and raped have been received from the Mopti region, where are over 1,000 cases recorded in this area so far in 2020.
UNHCR also fears that child marriages will also spiral, in a country where an estimated 53 per cent of girls are married before the age of 18.
Despite the conflict and COVID-19 movement restrictions, Mali continues to be a critical transit country for refugees and migrants attempting to reach northern Africa and Europe.
Some people on the move are trafficked for forced labour in the agricultural sector, others, particularly women are trafficked en route to promised jobs in North Africa, Europe and the Middle East.
Others are diverted to Bamako or to mining or agricultural areas where they are forced to engage in survival sex.
The profiles of traffickers and their accomplices range from organized criminal or armed groups, tribal chiefs or state authorities, to sometimes even parents, relatives or community members.
UNHCR continues to urge more support in efforts to prevent and respond to trafficking in persons, to protect those at risk, provide support to victims and ensure perpetrators are brought to justice.
Despite human rights violations, including gender-based violence, trafficking and child recruitment on the rise, a new report released yesterday warns that nearly 40 million internally displaced or conflict-affected people could be missing out on support due to insufficient funding.
According to the report, this year’s funding for protecting people most in need of assistance in humanitarian crises has received just 25 per cent of what is needed.
Notes to editors:
Globally, UNHCR is engaged in trafficking prevention and response activities for refugee, displaced and stateless people, leading an operational task team to combat trafficking as part of the Global Protection Cluster (GPC).

As vaccine supply continues to increase and becomes more readily available to the public in the coming weeks, President Biden has called for a “wartime effort” to increase the pace of vaccinations to limit the spread of COVID-19.
Leveraging the full potential of the private sector and supporting improved mechanisms for public-private coordination will be essential to ensuring more efficient and equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.
However, additional work is needed to identify remaining gaps that private sector resources can address and determine how these resources can most effectively complement and enhance ongoing state and local efforts to distribute, provide convenient access to, and support equitable uptake of COVID-19 vaccines.
This white paper highlights key opportunities and promising practices for public-private partnerships to support improved efficiency and equity in COVID-19 vaccine distribution, as well as considerations for public and private sector leaders in building multi-sector approaches to address emerging challenges.
To foster further advancement of innovative public-private partnerships for COVID-19 vaccine distribution and uptake, the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy and COVID Collaborative began convening vaccine experts, health systems, pharmacies, payers, employers, state leaders, and other private sector leaders for a series of virtual roundtables on opportunities for the private sector to partner with policymakers to address key challenges in vaccine distribution (see appendices for a list of roundtable participants and strategies highlighted in the white paper).
The roundtables have been supplemented with more extensive follow up on examples of promising practices.
Main opportunities identified in these discussions and described in this white paper include:
HIGH POINT, N.C., Nov. 30, 2021 – In the latest High Point University Poll, half (50%) of adults in North Carolina said they have received both doses of a two-dose COVID-19 vaccine, while 11% have received the single-dose vaccine, and 7% have received the first of two doses.
Just less than one-third (31%) of adults in North Carolina said they have not been vaccinated.
About half (49%) of North Carolinians said they are concerned about becoming sick with COVID-19, and 38% said that they are not concerned.
Only 8% of those surveyed said that they already tested positive for the virus, and 6% did not offer an opinion.
When asked about whether or not companies should be legally allowed to require employees to receive certain vaccines, North Carolinians were generally split.
About two in five (41%) of respondents said companies should be legally allowed to require certain vaccines, while 50% said they should not.
Another 9% of respondents did not offer an opinion.
The HPU Poll asked respondents how much they have heard about the delta variant of COVID-19.
About half (48%) of the adults surveyed said that they have heard a lot about the variant, about two-fifths (41%) said they had heard a little bit, while only 10% said that they heard almost nothing or offered no opinion.
When asked how concerned they were about this variant, about two in five (45%) of respondents said that they were either extremely concerned or very concerned.
About a one-quarter (24%) said that they were somewhat concerned, 17% said that they were not very concerned, and 10% said that they were not at all concerned.
The HPU Poll also asked North Carolinians if they received the seasonal influenza vaccine this year.
About two in five (44%) said yes and 55% said no.
Of those that responded no, about one-fifth (21%) said that they intend to receive the seasonal influenza vaccine this year, while about two-thirds (66%) said that they do not.
Another 12% offered no opinion either way.
“We continue to track concern that North Carolinians have about becoming sick with COVID-19,” said Brian McDonald, associate director of the HPU Poll and adjunct graduate school instructor.
“That being said, we continue to see about one-third of those surveyed still telling us that they have not received the COVID-19 vaccine.”
“Vaccination continues to be the most important tool we have to combat the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Jordan Smith, assistant professor of clinical sciences at HPU’s Fred Wilson School of Pharmacy.
“As COVID-19 variants like Delta demonstrate, the pandemic continues to pose challenges to our health care system.
With the emergence of the Omicron variant, it will be important that people continue to take appropriate health care measures, such as vaccination against COVID-19 and influenza.
This will ensure the best protection for themselves and their families, and to reduce the burden on our health care system.”

The most recent HPU Poll was fielded by live interviewers at the High Point University Survey Research Center calling on Nov. 11 through Nov. 19, 2021, and an online survey was fielded at the same time.
The responses from a sample of all North Carolina counties came from 867 adults interviewed online (811 respondents) as well as landline or cellular telephones (56 respondents).
The Survey Research Center contracted with dynata, formerly Research Now SSI, to acquire these samples, and fielded the online survey using the SRC’s Qualtrics platform.
This is a combined sample of live phone interviews and online interviews.
The online sampling is from a panel of respondents, so their participation does not adhere to usual assumptions associated with random selection.
Therefore, it is not appropriate to assign a classic margin of sampling error for the results.
In this case, the SRC provides a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points to account for a traditional 95% confidence interval for the estimates (plus or minus 3.3 percentage points) and a design effect of 1.2 (based on the weighting).
The data is weighted toward population estimates for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and education based on U.S. Census numbers for North Carolina.
Factors such as question wording and other methodological choices in conducting survey research can introduce additional errors into the findings of opinion polls.

PHILADELPHIA – The Federal Emergency Management Agency has provided more than $4 billion to Region 3 states and the District of Columbia for costs related to saving lives and protecting the public from COVID-19.
In addition to Washington, DC, Region 3 includes Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia.
Funds were distributed among local partners, state partners, school districts, other public entities, and certain private nonprofits.

Hanoi, 24 February 2020 –
In support of Viet Nam’s ongoing response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) made available for use in four regional laboratory institutes and a number of designated national hospitals some laboratory supplies required to detect the COVID-19 virus.
These testing reagents are produced abroad and shipped to various countries, including Viet Nam, through WHO.
The test, a real-time RT-PCR, is a molecular test that detects genetic material.
It needs to be conducted in molecular testing laboratories.
The National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE), Pasteur Institute Ho Chi Minh, Tay Nguyen Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Pasteur Institute Nha Trang and some designated hospitals – the recipients of the COVID-19 virus testing reagents – have the facility and resources to conduct the same laboratory methods for other pathogens.
NIHE, one of the two national influenza centres in Viet Nam, has the facilities and resources to conduct laboratory testing for COVID-19 virus.

Following WHO’s provision of the required laboratory supplies, the Ministry of Health and the above-mentioned regional institutes, with support from WHO and other development partners, will provide the necessary training so that the testing protocols using these reagents can be rolled out as soon as possible.
“WHO, together with other international partners, have long been supporting Viet Nam in strengthening its laboratory capacity for infectious diseases, as required by the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005).
Through this investment, the country now has a strong laboratory system, including for advanced molecular testing, which is required for COVID-19 detection.
To further support laboratory testing, WHO has been facilitating access of countries, including Viet Nam, to the newly developed tests.
We are committed to continue working with the Ministry of Health and other partners to ensure the country’s continued and quality testing for this new virus,” said Dr Kidong Park, WHO Representative in Viet Nam.
Pamela Valfer needed multiple covid tests after repeatedly visiting the hospital last fall to see her mother, who was being treated for cancer.
Beds there were filling with covid patients.
Valfer heard the tests would be free.
This story also ran on Fortune.
It can be republished for free.
So, she was surprised when the testing company billed her insurer $250 for each swab.
She feared she might receive a bill herself.
And that amount is toward the low end of what some hospitals and doctors have collected.
Hospitals are charging up to $650 for a simple, molecular covid test that costs $50 or less to run, according to Medicare claims analyzed for KHN by Hospital Pricing Specialists (HPS).
Charges by large health systems range from $20 to $1,419 per test, a new national survey by KFF shows.
And some free-standing emergency rooms are charging more than $1,000 per test.
Authorities were saying “get tested, no one’s going to be charged, and it turns out that’s not true,” said Valfer, a professor of visual arts who lives in Pasadena, California.
“Now on the back end it’s being passed onto the consumer” through high charges to insurers, she said.
The insurance company passes on its higher costs to consumers in higher premiums.

As the pandemic enters its second year, no procedure has been more frequent than tests for the virus causing it.
Gargantuan volume — 400 million tests and counting, for one type — combined with loose rules on prices have made the service a bonanza for hospitals and clinics, new data shows.
Lab companies have been booking record profits by charging $100 per test.
Even in-network prices negotiated and paid by insurance companies often run much more than that and, according to one measure, have been rising on average in recent months.
Insurers and other payers “have no bargaining power in this game” because there is no price cap in some situations, said Ge Bai, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who has studied test economics.
When charges run far beyond the cost of the tests “it’s predatory,” she said.
“It’s price gouging.”
The data shows that covid tests continue to generate high charges from hospitals and clinics despite alarms raised by insurers, anecdotal reports of high prices and pushback from state regulators.
The listed charge for a basic PCR covid test at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles is $480.
NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital lists $440 as the gross charge as well as the cash price.
Those amounts are far above the $159 national average for the diagnostic test, which predominated during the first year of the pandemic, at more than 3,000 hospitals checked by HPS.
That’s the amount billed to insurance companies, not what patients pay, Cedars spokesperson Cara Martinez said in an email.
“Patients themselves do not face any costs” for the tests, she said.
“The amounts we charge [insurers] for medical care are set to cover our operating costs,” capital needs and other items, she said.
Likewise at NewYork-Presbyterian, charges not covered by insurance “are not passed along to patients,” the hospital said.
Many hospitals and labs follow the Medicare reimbursement rate, $100 for results within two days from high-volume tests.
But there are outliers.
Insurers oftentimes negotiate lower prices within their networks, although not for labs and testing options outside their purview.
Billing by hospitals and clinics from outside insurance company networks can be especially lucrative because the government requires insurers to pay their posted covid-test price with no limit.
Regulation for out-of-network vaccine charges, by contrast, is stricter.
Charges for vaccines must be “reasonable,” according to federal regulations, with relatively low Medicare prices as a possible guideline.
“There’s a problem with the federal law” on test prices, said Sabrina Corlette, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.
“The CARES Act requires insurers to pay the full billed charge to the provider.
Unless they’ve negotiated, their hands are tied.”
But even in-network payments can be highly profitable.
Optim Medical Center in Tattnall, Georgia, part of a chain of orthopedic practices and medical centers, collects $308 per covid test from two insurers, its price list shows.
Yale New Haven Hospital collects $182 from one insurer and $173 from another.
Yale New Haven’s prices resulted from existing insurer agreements addressing unspecified new procedures such as the covid test, said Patrick McCabe, senior vice president of finance for Yale New Haven Health.
“We didn’t negotiate” specifically on covid tests, he said.
“We’re not trying to take advantage of a crisis here.”
Officials from Optim Medical Center did not respond to queries from KHN.
Castlight Health, which provides benefits and health care guidance to more than 60 Fortune 500 companies, analyzed for KHN the costs of 1.1 million covid tests billed to insurers from March 2020 through this February.
The analysis found an average charge of $90, with less than 1% of bills passing any cost along to the patient.
Since last March, the average cost has gone up from $63 to as high as $97 per test in December before declining to $89 in February, the most recent results available.
In some cases, hospitals and clinics have supplemented revenue from covid tests with extra charges that go far beyond those for a simple swab.
Warren Goldstein was surprised when Austin Emergency Center, in Texas, charged him and his wife $494 upfront for two covid tests.
He was shocked when the center billed insurance $1,978 for his test, which he expected would cost $100.
His insurer paid $325 for “emergency services” for him, even though there was no emergency.
“It seemed like highway robbery,” said Goldstein, a New York professor who was visiting his daughter and grandchild in Texas at the time.
Austin Emergency Center has been the subject of previous reports of high covid-test prices.
The center provides “high-quality health care emergency services” and “our charges are set at the price that we believe reflects this quality of care,” said Heather Neale, AEC’s chief operating officer.
The law requires the center to examine every patient “to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition exists,” she said.
Curative, the lab company that billed $250 for Valfer’s PCR tests, said through a spokesperson that its operating costs are higher than those of other providers and that consumers will never be billed for charges insurance doesn’t cover.
Valfer’s insurer paid $125 for each test, claims documents show.
Even at relatively low prices, testing companies are reaping high profits.
Covid PCR tests sold for $100 apiece helped Quest Diagnostics increase revenue by 49% in the first quarter of 2021 and quadruple its profits compared with the same period a year ago.
“We are expecting … to still do quite well in terms of reimbursement in the near term,” Quest CFO Mark Guinan said during a recent earnings call.
Hospitals and clinics do pay tens of thousands of dollars upfront when purchasing analyzer machines, plus costs for chemical reagents, swabs and other collection materials, maintenance, and training and compensating staff members.
But the more tests completed, the more cost-effective they are, said Marlene Sautter, director of laboratory services at Premier Inc., a group purchasing organization that works with 4,000 U.S. hospitals and health systems.
A World Health Organization cost assessment of running 5,000 covid tests on Roche and Abbott analyzers — not including that initial equipment price, labor or shipping costs — came to $17 and $21 per test, respectively.
Unlike earlier in the pandemic, lab-based PCR tests no longer dominate the market.
Cheaper, rapid options can now be purchased online or in stores.
In mid-April, some CVS, Walmart and Walgreens stores began selling a two-pack of Abbott Laboratories’ BinaxNOW antigen test for $23.99.
Regulations require insurers to cover covid testing administered or referred by a health care provider at no cost to the patient.
But exceptions are made for public health surveillance and work- or school-related testing.
Claire Lemcke, who works for a Flagstaff, Arizona, nonprofit, was tested at a mall in January and received a statement from an out-of-state lab company saying that the price was $737, that it was performed out-of-network and that she would be responsible for paying.
She’s working with her insurer, which has already paid $400, to try to get it settled.
Sticker shock from covid tests has gotten bad enough that Medicare set up a hotline for insurance companies to report bad actors, and states across the country are taking action.
Free-standing emergency centers across Texas, like the one Goldstein visited, have charged particularly exorbitant prices, propelling the Texas Association of Health Plans to write a formal complaint in late January.
The 19-page letter details how many of these operations violate state disclosure requirements, charge over $1,000 per covid test and add thousands more in facility fees associated with the visit.
These free-standing ERs are “among the worst offenders when it comes to price gouging, egregious billing, and providing unnecessary care and tests,” the letter says.
In December, the Kansas Insurance Department investigated a lab whose cash price was listed at nearly $1,000.
State legislatures in both Minnesota and Connecticut have introduced bills to crack down on price gouging since the pandemic began.
"If these astronomical costs charged by unscrupulous providers are borne by the health plans and insurers without recompense, consumers will ultimately pay more for their health care as health insurance costs will rise,” Justin McFarland, Kansas Insurance Department’s general counsel, wrote in a Dec. 16 letter.
In so many ways, the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic left us with more questions than answers.
How did the virus spread?
What activities were safe?
When would life return to normal?
The questions were no less plentiful or urgent for the researchers who study the nature of scientific advances at Kellogg’s Center for Science of Science and Innovation.
How has the pandemic affected science in both the short and long term?
What role has science played in addressing the wide-ranging implications of this global crisis?
And what lessons can we learn about the nature of scientific progress by studying how scientists adapted their research during the past year?
“It was quickly clear that we were in the biggest crisis of our generation, yet we knew so little about how the pandemic was impacting science and innovation,” explains CSSI Director Dashun Wang, who is an associate professor of management and organizations at Kellogg.
What was also abundantly clear was that the world was looking to science and innovation to save us, explains Benjamin Jones, a Kellogg strategy professor.
The record speed at which scientists were attempting to develop vaccines—using technology that relied on decades of prior research—highlights, as Jones says, “that science is fundamental to human progress, which means that studying the science of science can generate extremely high social returns.”
So back in the spring of 2020, he and his colleagues got to work investigating the activities of their fellow scientists.
Here’s a look at what they have since found.
BEIJING (AP) — China on Tuesday said it has been “open and transparent” in the search for the origins of COVID-19, after questions about how the pandemic began received new attention.
Most recently, the U.S. Department of Energy assessed with “low confidence” that the pandemic that was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 began with the leak of a virus from a lab.
The report hasn’t been made public.

China had “shared the most data and research results on virus tracing and made important contributions to global virus tracing research,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning Mao told reporters at a daily briefing.
“Politicizing the issue of virus tracing will not smear China but will only damage the U.S.’s own credibility,” Mao said, in response to complaints from U.S. officials and members of Congress that China has not been entirely cooperative.
Her comments came amid continuing questions about how the virus that has killed more than 6.8 million people worldwide first emerged.
Others in the U.S. intelligence community disagree with the U.S. Energy Department assessment of the lab leak, citing differing opinions within the government.
“There is just not an intelligence community consensus,” John Kirby, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Monday.
READ MORE: WHO team concludes coronavirus unlikely to have leaked from China lab
The DOE conclusion was first reported over the weekend in the Wall Street Journal, which said the classified report was based on new intelligence and noted in an update to a 2021 document.
The DOE oversees a national network of labs in the U.S.
White House officials on Monday declined to confirm press reports about the assessment.
In 2021, officials released an intelligence report summary that said four members of the U.S. intelligence community believed with low confidence that the virus was first transmitted from an animal to a human, and a fifth believed with moderate confidence that the first human infection was linked to a lab.
On July 29, President Biden announced that federal employees must be vaccinated against COVID-19 or meet other conditions, including wearing masks and undergoing periodic testing for COVID-19 infection.
Growing numbers of private employers have also announced vaccine requirements for employees to return to work.
This fact sheet reviews what employers can and cannot do under current rules to require or encourage vaccination of their workers.
Can employers require employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19?
In general, yes, employers can require employees who physically enter the workplace to be vaccinated for COVID-19, and before the pandemic, other employer vaccine mandates have been applied, such as a requirement to get a flu vaccine.
For any vaccine mandate, key standards apply under federal law:
First, a mandatory workplace vaccination program must meet standards under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of being “job related” and “consistent with business necessity.”
This involves making a determination about the threat to safety posed by unvaccinated employees.
The determination will rest on facts and circumstances involving the workplace and job – such as whether work is conducted indoors or outdoors, or the frequency and duration of an unvaccinated employee’s interaction with other people.
In addition, the determination must take into account the most current medical knowledge about COVID-19, such as the level of community spread of the virus.
CDC is a key source of current medical knowledge about COVID-19.
Second, under the ADA, employers are generally required to provide reasonable accommodations for employees who, due to a disability (including pregnancy) do not get vaccinated against COVID-19.
Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, reasonable accommodations are also required for employees who do not comply based on a sincerely held religious belief.
Such accommodations are required unless they would pose an undue hardship, or substantial difficulty or expense, on the employer.
If it is determined that an unvaccinated employee could pose a safety threat, the employer must consider whether a reasonable accommodation could reduce or eliminate that threat.
For example, unvaccinated employees might be required to wear masks, or get periodic tests for COVID-19, or be given the choice to telework.
Third, employers must not apply the vaccination requirement in ways that treat employees differently – on the basis race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or genetic information – in violation of other federal equal opportunity (EO) laws.
Finally, the employer can ask employees about their vaccine status or require proof of vaccination.
The ADA generally restricts employers from making disability-related inquiries of employees.
However, EEOC guidance states that asking about COVID-19 vaccination status is not a disability-related inquiry under the ADA, as there are numerous reasons why people might not be vaccinated.
If an employee has not been vaccinated due to a disability or sincerely held religious belief or another reason protected under federal EO laws, as noted above, then reasonable accommodations must be considered.
Can employers offer incentives to be vaccinated?
In general, yes, it is permissible for employers to offer workers incentives to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
These could include cash payments, gift cards, or other rewards or penalties.
The EEOC guidance notes that federal law generally would not limit the size of such incentives, with one key exception noted below.
The guidance also says employers can take other steps to encourage or facilitation vaccination without violating federal laws.
These include providing information to educate employees about the vaccine and its benefits and to address common questions and concerns.
Employers can also offer time-off for vaccination and to recover from any side effects.
The American Rescue Plan Act makes tax credits available to employers to cover the cost of providing paid leave to employees to receive and recover from COVID-19 vaccinations.
Special restrictions on incentives would apply in the case of employers that offer a COVID vaccination program directly to employees.
That is because, prior to administration of the vaccine, CDC requires pre-screening questions about health history, allergies, pregnancy status, etc., and, when the employer or its agent directly provides the vaccine, such pre-screening questions would constitute a disability-related inquiry by the employer.
Under the ADA, disability-related inquiries through an employer health program, including a workplace wellness program, are permitted only if participation in that program is voluntary.
The definition of “voluntary” under the ADA, and whether that could encompass incentives, has been the subject of controversy and litigation.
When the ADA was first implemented, EEOC guidance made clear that a voluntary employer health or wellness program could not require participation nor penalize employees for not participating.
Then, in 2015, an EEOC regulation revised the definition “voluntary” workplace health and wellness programs to include those that imposed substantial financial penalties – up to 30% of the cost of self-only coverage under the employer’s health plan.
A federal court overturned that regulation, ruling that the redefinition of “voluntary” was arbitrary and capricious.
In 2020, the agency began work on a revised regulation to permit wellness program incentives, but suspended activity in 2021.
With regard to employer-provided COVID-19 vaccination programs, current EEOC guidance allows incentives (which includes both rewards and penalties) to participate if incentives are not so large as to be coercive.
The agency does not, however, provide any detail on how large of an incentive would constitute coercion.
Guidance also makes clear that the incentive size limit – whatever it may be – does not apply if an employer offers an incentive to employees to voluntarily provide documentation that they received COVID-19 vaccination from a community provider.
How does FDA emergency use authorization affect COVID-19 mandates?
The US Department of Justice issued a recent opinion stating that employers and other entities are not prohibited from imposing vaccination requirements solely because the vaccine(s) are only available subject to FDA emergency use authorization (EUA).
Earlier, at least one federal lawsuit had been filed challenging an employer’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate on the grounds that vaccines are still subject to EUA.
It is possible that other legal challenges to employer vaccine mandates could arise.
State laws and employer vaccine requirements
In response to federal guidance, legislation has been introduced in many states to prohibit or restrict employers, including public employers, from requiring COVID-19 vaccinations as a condition of work.
As of July 29, such legislation had been enacted in 7 states and was pending in two others.
As a result, even when employers comply with all federal law requirements, it is possible that vaccine mandates could be challenged under state laws.
The anti-diabetic drug metformin, when taken at the time of Covid-19 infection, could reduce the rate of long Covid-19, a new study found.
In the Phase III COVID-OUT study (NCT04510194), patients who used metformin at the time of Covid-19 infection had a 41% reduction in long Covid rates.
The study results shed light on a potential preventive treatment for a condition that clinicians have struggled to treat effectively.
During the COVID-OUT study, investigators tested three generic drugs— metformin, fluvoxamine, and ivermectin—as outpatient treatments for 1,350 patients with acute Covid-19.
The patients were then followed for around nine additional months to monitor for long Covid symptoms.
Long Covid, also known as post-acute sequelae of Covid-19 (PASC), describes the persistent symptoms that can occur after an acute Covid-19 infection.
These can include shortness of breath, fatigue, brain fog, and an array of other respiratory and cognitive symptoms.
Despite significant drug development activity, researchers have thus far had only limited success in developing treatments for long Covid.
Metformin and long Covid
Metformin, an anti-inflammatory agent normally used to lower blood sugar, is taken by approximately 150 million people worldwide.
Given the generic drug’s low cost and widespread use, researchers are hopeful it could provide an affordable preventive measure for long Covid.

In the COVID-OUT study, patients receiving metformin at the time of infection also had a 42% reduction in emergency room visits, hospitalisations, or death.
This suggests the drug could also work as an effective outpatient treatment.
Researchers said metformin could also provide a potential alternative to Pfizer’s oral Covid-19 antiviral Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir + ritonavir).
Though Paxlovid is widely considered the standard of care, approximately one in three people cannot take the antiviral due to potential cross-interactions.
You may feel that the stress level in your home has been raised since the COVID-19 pandemic began.
Changes in routine have led to the removal of usual support systems that help our families with their mental and spiritual framework.
This may include faith and religious community groups, faith formation confirmation and other programs, after-school activities, clubs and school.
Thankfully, spirituality and religion offers help for dealing with anxiousness during crises like COVID-19.
The hope for a quick resolution of COVID-19 may be a little idealistic, yet parents can combat anxiousness in the family by bolstering some resemblance of the ordinary, normal life.
Remember that an event doesn't necessarily equal a crisis.
COVID-19 is a stress-filled event for many, and it is filled with challenges.
These challenges should not be under- or overestimated, but we can take steps to lessen the impact so it doesn't become a crisis.
People under stress have normal reactions to an abnormal event.
This includes feeling anxious when an event feels unpredictable.
While COVID-19 is an abnormal event, it is an event we will eventually get through, and, as my particular faith likes to say with regard to God, "We are more than conquerors.
"
Here are 3 spiritual health tips you can try to lower anxiety levels in your family:
1.
Model good coping behaviors.
While we all are anxious in some ways, we can be less anxious by working on our own anxiety.
For some, this might include taking medications, doing exercise, or getting involved in mindfulness or similar activities.
Whatever you do for coping, it potentially will benefit your family since they are influenced by your aura of calm.
A friend used to say to me: "You know, chaplain, when we see you and your colleagues come around, we don't think things are quite as bad."
How true that is for all of us.
We can be anxious, yet control our anxiety.
Part of the benefit could be lowered stress levels and increased physical well-being with our immune system.
One of my favorite movies, "The Bishop's Wife," has a scene where a character is about to enter a meeting filled with conflict.
You can hear the shouting on the other side of the doors.
She could hear the group inside criticizing her husband.
However, prior to opening the doors, she stopped and centered herself for a moment.
Then she proceeded in with guarded, but cautious, optimism.
This action was able to lower the negativity of the environment.
In the same way, it helps us to come to stop, gather our thoughts and take a deep breath in the moment.
It can make a big difference.
Music, massage and spiritual direction also are just a few other options to help you so you can help your family better cope with COVID-19 anxiousness.
2.
Answer questions over dinner.
One of the best questions I like to ask during dinners is: "What are three good things that happened today or this week?"
The responses often are one-line zingers filled with laughter.
The point is to celebrate the good.
A former colleague used to begin each leadership meeting with this question, and it set the tone for the entire meeting.
It is easy to start and keep on filling a home with negative energy, whereas a positive beginning produces an atmosphere of getting started on the proverbial right foot.
Our families can help by being involved as leaders in these discussions.
Other suggestions include playing a board game, going for a ride in the country or taking a walk.
We can continue to connect with others in unique and safe ways.
A recent news story showed how a son visited with his father at a nursing home using his phone and looking at each other through the window.
In another story, two people played a game together from their apartment balconies.
Model how you can creatively connect with people, because we do need each other and these safe interactions can be learning experiences for better coping.
3.
Carry forward lessons learned during COVID-19.
Most of us remember where we were during tragic national events, such as 9/11 or the space shuttle Challenger exploding.
COVID-19 will be remembered for a long time, and how we coped with it will be etched into our memory.
Your family may be feeling a lot of anxiety right now, but reflect on what you can learn in this crisis for present and future coping.
Think about how you can preserve these skills and how you can use it to strengthen family relationships.
Remember the Etch a Sketch toy?
May we not shake this crisis off like an Etch a Sketch drawing after this crisis is over.
We will make it through this.

June 24, 2020:
Observed Activity Update
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to take hold in various geographical locations, government and businesses are rapidly changing how and where they operate to ensure the safety and health of their employees, customers and partners.
This environment is dynamic, and the continually shifting paradigm has significant consequences on organizational security posture.
“Work from home” is becoming the new normal for organizations hoping to flatten the curve of the pandemic.
For some organizations, remote work has been ongoing for several years, and the new push is simply a matter of scaling up existing solutions and policies.
In many other environments, work from home is a foreign concept; technology, operations and policies are not prepared for this new reality, and several challenges are being encountered such as:
Use of personal devices and email for business or handling sensitive information
Provisioning corporate assets to support remote working arrangements
Proper deployment and configuration of remote services, corporate VPNs and related two-factor authentication methods
Adversaries are keenly aware of these challenges and the opportunities for abusing this situation to their advantage.
This blog provides an overview of tactics and observed cyber threats beginning in January 2020 through publication.
Tactic Highlight: Phishing
Phishing remains the primary initial access vector for a variety of threat actors.
Successful phishing attacks frequently play to greed or fear in the victim.
The infamous “Nigerian Prince” schemes are an example of the use of greed, where the promise of riches entices the victim to do things they ordinarily wouldn’t do.
In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, fear abounds, and the awareness of the pandemic itself is global.
Phishing attacks promise new information about the virus or updates on official guidance.
In addition to what has been observed, CrowdStrike® Intelligence assesses with high confidence that it is likely for additional phishing campaigns to make use of lures aligned with health guidance, containment and infection-rate news to increase over the next few months.
In addition to phishing lures leveraging health-related interest, there is also a possibility that actors could take advantage of more employees working from home, and move toward lures attempting to spoof company guidance and procedures, human resource correspondence and company information technology (IT) issues and resources.
While such exploitative operations have not been directly observed at this time, targeted intrusion adversaries in particular have relied on job-themed and human resource-themed lure documents over the last few months.
In a situation where employees will increasingly rely on email communications to continue business operations, the threat of phishing campaigns attempting to mimic official business communications will likely increase.
Observed Activity: eCrime
As the pandemic continues to evolve, CrowdStrike has observed sustained eCrime activity across the board, including some with COVID-19 themes.
Campaigns have been observed in multiple languages, using multiple attachment types and various levels of COVID-19 information, demonstrating that the scope of these campaigns has been and is likely to remain wide.
COVID-19-themed activity has followed the path of the virus as it has moved from Asia across the world.
As news about the situation in various locales emerges, the themes and targets change — for example, with recent news of the desperate situation in Italy, WIZARD SPIDER was observed deploying dynamic web inject files that solely target customers of Italian financial institutions, with the intent of stealing credentials for accounts.
One of the earliest eCrime actors to capitalize on the COVID-19 outbreak was MUMMY SPIDER in late January 2020.
This actor used Japanese-language spam spoofing a public health center in order to distribute the Emotet downloader malware, which subsequently led to the download and install of WIZARD SPIDER’s TrickBot.
CrowdStrike Intelligence has continued to identify multiple campaigns distributing additional eCrime threats, such as Gozi ISFB, Nemty ransomware, SCULLY SPIDER’s DanaBot, GRACEFUL SPIDER’s GetAndGo Loader and the Latin America-targeted malware Kiron.
There have also been instances of eCrime actors attempting to sell COVID-19-themed tools, including a phishing method using a payload preloader masked as a COVID-19 map.
Observed Activity: Targeted Intrusion
Despite the impact of COVID-19 on their respective countries, CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed multiple nation-state-affiliated targeted intrusion adversaries remaining active with spear-phishing campaigns throughout the last few months.
Moreover, many of these adversaries have already been observed using COVID-19-themed operations: China-based PIRATE PANDA was observed using COVID-19-themed lure documents in February 2020; Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) adversary VELVET CHOLLIMA has also remained active and recently leveraged a COVID-19-themed lure document to deliver its unique BabyShark malware against South Korea-based organizations.
Tactic: Targeting Remote Services
It is possible that companies will increase the use of software as a service (SaaS) and cloud-based remote connectivity services in order to enable and support employees working from home.
Standing up remote working services could pose a potential security risk when combined with possible human-error-enabled security lapses.
Criminal actors in particular continually seek to collect credentials for these services, potentially allowing them to gain access to these SaaS accounts and victim organization data.
The eCrime big game hunting (BGH) ransomware industry in particular leverages Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) brute forcing or password spraying for initial entry.
As many sophisticated BGH actors remain highly active at present, they will likely attempt to capitalize on possible staffing disruptions COVID-19 may bring to organizations, as well as attempt to compromise employee devices while they work remotely.
Tactic: Vishing Robocall and Tech Support Scams
As employees shift to flexible work arrangements such as telecommuting, they will increasingly rely on phone communications to maintain and continue business operations.
Adversaries will likely take advantage of this situation and conduct malicious operations attempting to mimic official business communications.
Such operations could include voice phishing or “vishing” and robocall scams, as well as technical support scams.
Criminals have been observed using the COVID-19 outbreak as a theme in vishing and robocall scams.
A portion of these calls have initially focused on targets on the U.S. West Coast, as well as industries affected by the outbreak, such as transportation and travel.
In some cases, vishing can be combined with smishing (text message phishing) in order to perpetrate such scams or load malicious content onto mobile devices.
Technical support scams use various delivery methods including phone calls, pop-up warnings or redirects.
Although the theme of these scams may not be directly related to COVID-19, the increase in office workers transitioning to remote work in the near term poses the risk of increased tech support scams targeting those individuals, who may not be adept at or self-sufficient in remote computing.
Recommendations for Defending Against COVID-19 Scams
As the global COVID-19 outbreak grows, CrowdStrike assesses that malicious cyber threat actors will continue to take advantage of the situation.
As such, it is imperative that businesses and employees remain aware of the potential cyber threats they face while they make transitions to alternative business continuity plans, and that they are informed of the immediate steps they can take to mitigate potential risks.
In order to help customers cope with these new and unexpected developments, CrowdStrike is offering two limited-time programs.
They address the challenges introduced by the large number of managed and unmanaged devices being used by newly remote workers.
Observed Activity Update: Wednesday, June 24
In the past week, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed the following notable threats using COVID-19 themes.
CrowdStrike Intelligence continues to observe eCrime adversaries using social engineering techniques and malicious documents referencing COVID-19.
The following table provides an overview of notable criminal malware from the past week that referenced COVID-19 in malicious filenames.

The volume of malicious COVID-19 files has declined for two consecutive weeks.
CrowdStrike Intelligence recently identified a COVID-19-themed spam campaign targeting Spain-based victims to deliver the Latin American Culebra Variant Trojan.
The email addresses the alleged misuse of masks in public places.
(The use of masks in Spain is currently mandatory in locations where social distancing cannot be maintained.)
Culebra Variant currently targets financial institutions in Brazil, Chile, and Spain.
Additional analysis of Culebra Variant confirms it is likely based on the same source code as Culebra malware, whose code has likely been leaked, raising the potential for new Culebra-associated variants appearing in the wild.
Observed Activity Update: Monday, June 15
In the past week, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed the following notable threats using COVID-19 themes.
In early June 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed a phishing campaign targeting a broad scope of organizations in various sectors and geographies involved in the COVID-19 pandemic response.
The campaign relies on a large number of phishing URLs associated with a Russia-based IP address.
Additional analysis confirms the following tactics: Malicious HTM files sent as attachments in phishing emails HTM files display a message telling the user to log in, review, and authorize a company policy.
Most referred to the company’s “Reimbursement Policy,” but one file referred to the company’s “Covid-19 Relief Plan”
The messages spoof the target company’s Human Resources Department
The HTM file redirects the user to malicious actor-controlled infrastructure hosting a phishing page for Microsoft credentials
The likely intent is to obtain access to organizations by compromising legitimate accounts.
Stolen credentials can then be used to perform account takeovers, from which additional phishing campaigns can be launched.
Public reporting has listed a German-based multinational corporation as one of the targeted entities.
CrowdStrike Intelligence has identified additional victims in the technology, industrials and engineering, financial, retail, energy, and healthcare sectors.
CrowdStrike Intelligence continues to observe eCrime adversaries using social engineering techniques and malicious documents referencing COVID-19.

Threat actors continue to use COVID-19 themes heavily.
While file volume fluctuates between weeks, the pandemic remains relevant despite some countries relaxing social distancing guidelines.
Observed Activity Update: Thursday, June 4
In the past week, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed the following notable threats using COVID-19 themes.
A new ransomware variant named F*ckUnicorn began targeting victims in Italy via spam campaigns with a COVID-19 theme.
The ransomware, which is a variant of the open-source Hidden Tear ransomware, was circulated using lures referring to the Italian government’s rollout for their COVID-19 track-and-trace application.
The ransomware is of below average sophistication and contains numerous cryptographic weaknesses that may allow for the free recovery of files.
Based on the use of the Italian language and structure, CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses that the author is likely a native Italian speaker.
The following table provides an overview of indicators used in the spam campaign.

In the blog post, “ MalSpam in the time of COVID-19 ,” the CrowdStrike data science team examines five different malicious email spam (MalSpam) campaigns.
This blog examines the social engineering methods used to deliver the payload and examine the behavior of the delivered malware.
Observed Activity Update: Tuesday, May 26
Since March, CrowdStrike Intelligence has repeatedly observed eCrime adversaries using COVID-19 as a theme for socially engineered phishing campaigns.
The malicious payloads have included a mixture of commodity malware and loaders, with several variants dominating the threat landscape — namely AgentTesla, LokiBot, NanoCore and FormBook.
A common tactic has been to directly reference COVID-19 in the name of the malicious spam email file attachment.
Previously detected examples include: COVID-19_UPDATE.jpg.lnk CoronaVirusSafetyMeasures_pdf.exe Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) CURE.zip COVID-19 Communication to corporate Clients.rar A reduced detection rate of these files over the past three weeks indicates the tactic may be on the decline — potentially as intended victims have become more aware of the phishing threats.
Instead, CrowdStrike Intelligence has detected a slight shift toward techniques and lure themes that make less obvious COVID-19-related references, and include more generic file attachment names.
Popular among these emerging techniques is the use of fake invoice and purchase order invoices, asking the recipient to interact with an attached file that has a generic name (e.g., PO and DETAILS7657.doc or OVERDUE INVOICES.rar ), and making only a passing reference to the pandemic within the email body.
This shift in social engineering techniques does not necessarily reduce the threat — as the final payloads have remained consistent — but demonstrates the evolving nature of socially engineered phishing attacks.
On May 19, 2020, an affiliate of LUNAR SPIDER distributed a spam campaign that uses a COVID-19-themed lure to deliver the commodity banking malware BokBot (aka IcedID).
The sample identified by CrowdStrike Intelligence makes reference to a change in legislation regarding requests for employee leave under the U.S. Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) during the pandemic, and claims to originate from “COVID-19 CENTER” using a spoofed email address.
The email has a Microsoft Office Word (.doc) attachment titled FMLAINSTRUCTIONS.doc , which purportedly contains further information.
Opening this document and enabling macros triggers the extraction, writing and running of an executable file ( PFSDNSKDF.EXE ).

Some vendors on known criminal marketplaces seek to capitalize on the pandemic by offering phishing kits and scam pages for sale.
CrowdStrike Intelligence recently identified a post by a marketplace vendor advertising a job opportunity assisting with editing a COVID-19-related scam page.
Several new domains referencing pharmaceutical companies and COVID-19 were detected on May 13, 2020, by CrowdStrike Intelligence.
The naming conventions of the domains were relatively similar, for example:
[company_name]corona.com [company_name]covid.com corona[company_name].com Covid19-[company_name].com
eCrime adversaries frequently use fraudulent domains to serve as phishing pages—one of the newly identified domains included several subdomains with spoof credential login portals, highly likely intended to capture employee credentials.
As well as being lucrative targets for attacks by eCrime actors, pharmaceutical companies and their employees are at heightened risk of phishing attacks by targeted intrusion actors conducting intelligence-gathering operations pertaining to COVID-19 response efforts.
A Brazilian hacktivist group known as Digital Space is promoting links to their website, which is hosting databases sourced from five separate data breaches.
The leaks are being promoted across associated social media accounts alongside the hashtag #Opcovid19.
Under this operation name, multiple hacktivist groups have claimed responsibility for conducting attacks against government and health ministry entities.
Brazilian hacktivist groups appear to be using a Discord server to centralize and plan operations, which could result in future coordinated operations.
On May 15, 2020, Romanian law enforcement, led by Romania’s Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT), arrested four criminals that are reported to be members of a hacking group called PentaGuard.
The four individuals were said to be planning to use ransomware against hospitals in Romania.
A statement from DIICOT said these individuals “intended to launch ransomware attacks, in the near future, on public health institutions in Romania, generally hospitals, using social engineering by sending a malicious executable application, from the ‘Locky’ or ‘BadRabbit’ (computer virus) families, hidden in an email and in the form of a file that apparently would come from other government institutions, regarding the threat of COVID19.”
The ARCHER high-performance computing (HPC) network, a UK academic supercomputer possibly involved in modeling the spread of COVID-19, experienced an exploitation of its login nodes, according to media reporting .
The exploitation reportedly affected user passwords and SSH keys and has resulted in ARCHER’s system administrators suspending access to the network.
Speculation from unnamed sources posited that the HPC would be an “obvious” target for nation-states interested in stealing or disrupting academic research into COVID-19 in the United Kingdom.
ARCHER’s administrators indicated in a statement that other academic computers across Europe have also been compromised.

On April 28, 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed a spam campaign involving a Microsoft Teams-themed lure.
The emails redirected victims to a Microsoft-themed phishing page, highly likely seeking to capture users’ credentials.
Lures using video conferencing themes are highly likely seeking to capitalize on the COVID-19 pandemic, as more individuals and businesses adopt remote working practices during lockdown conditions.
A similar campaign was observed in mid-April 2019 purporting to originate from an individual attempting to communicate through Microsoft Teams and contained a hyperlink that directed the user to a phishing page.
CrowdStrike Intelligence observed a campaign by the Russia-based adversary PRIMITIVE BEAR that was leveraging COVID-19 lures to target suspected Ukrainian officials.
The observed spear-phishing messages associated with this campaign appeared to stem from at least mid-April 2020 and contained two attachments.
One of the attachments was a malicious document using the Template Injection technique to execute a VBA macro from an additional document retrieved from the internet when a victim opens the file.
This delivery chain—based on the Template Injection technique of retrieving templates from DDNS domains hosted at the Russian telecommunications provider Sprinthost—is consistent with previously observed PRIMITIVE BEAR phishing campaigns.

In early May 2020, open source reporting described recent credential collection activity targeting Western organizations involved in response efforts for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Reported target organizations include a prominent international public health organization as well as at least one major pharmaceutical company.
According to reports, this activity employed spear-phishing emails containing misleading links directing victims to generic adversary-controlled login pages.
Based on overlaps with previously-documented operations, CrowdStrike Intelligence attributes this activity with moderate confidence to the Iranian state-nexus adversary CHARMING KITTEN.
Observed Activity Update: Monday, May 4
eCrime actors continue to use social engineering techniques and malicious documents referring to COVID-19.
The most popular payload identified continues to be AgentTesla.
This commodity keylogger has been readily available for purchase on the internet since late 2014.
It is customizable, can be calibrated by each user, can also be bound to another file so that when executed, and it gives the impression of being a legitimate executable rather than a malicious file.
These are all elements that contribute to the continued popularity of the malware, and likely demonstrate why it has been one of the most readily distributed variants during the COVID-19 pandemic.
CrowdStrike Intelligence also observed activity from DOPPEL SPIDER, with a COVID-19-themed spam campaign to distribute DoppelDridex.
The email included an attachment named using a pattern of covid19_[0-9]{6}].xls .
This Microsoft Excel file contained embedded Excel 4.0 macros.
While not novel, this campaign demonstrates how eCrime actors continue to use both COVID-19 themes and Excel 4.0 macro documents to deliver malware.
This campaign was likely opportunistic in scope; identified targets spanned several sectors, including energy, financial services, manufacturing, professional services and retail.
It is important to note that DOPPEL SPIDER often uses DoppelDridex infections to gain an understanding of their victims and assess their viability for DoppelPaymer ransomware operations.
Observed Activity Update: Monday, April 27
A spam campaign distributing Hancitor used a COVID-19-related lure impersonating a U.S.-based health insurance company and referencing the purchase of a protection plan.
A previous Hancitor campaign identified in March 2020 used a similar tactic.
Malicious URLs included in the malspam emails hosted Microsoft Excel 4.0 documents containing macros, which triggered the retrieval and execution of Hancitor.
The final payloads were identified as Pony and CRE Stealer.
On April 21, 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence detected a phishing kit likely targeting UK-based victims.
The kit used a lure referencing COVID-19 and prompted the visitor to enter personally identifiable information (PII), as well as passport details, marital status, and employment status.
This information could almost certainly be used to conduct additional phishing attacks or to perform fraudulent activity.
CrowdStrike Intelligence has analyzed samples of the COVID-19-themed Master Boot Record (MBR) locker CoViper and determined it possesses no significant destructive capabilities.
The malware had been publicly reported as targeting civilian infrastructure entities in the Czech Republic.
Netwalker ransomware is developed and operated by the criminal adversary CIRCUS SPIDER.
Netwalker ransomware has been actively used by criminal actors since September 2019; earlier names given to this ransomware family were Mailto, Koko, and KazKavKovKiz.
The use of COVID-19 lures and targeting entities in the healthcare sector indicate that the operators of Netwalker are taking advantage of the global pandemic in order to gain notoriety and increase their customer base.
CrowdStrike Intelligence has obtained a malicious macro-enabled Microsoft Word document themed with COVID-19 content that delivers a KonniFTP downloader to victim hosts.
CrowdStrike attributes the Konni family of malware to VELVET CHOLLIMA with moderate confidence, and it is likely the described document originated from this adversary.
VELVET CHOLLIMA frequently makes use of current events in its lure documents.
While this activity does not represent a significant deviation from the threat actor’s previous tactics, techniques or procedures (TTPs), this latest effort highlights that this DPRK adversary remains active.
Observed Activity Update: Monday, April 20
eCrime actors continue to use social engineering techniques and malicious documents referring to COVID-19.
Impersonation of the World Health Organization (WHO) remains a popular social engineering technique in phishing campaigns.
CrowdStrike Intelligence recently observed a new campaign that used a spoof sender address ( WHO <eurohealthycities@who[.]int> ).
The emails delivered the “AgentTesla” information stealer using an exploit document known as “Virgo.”
AgentTesla has been one of the most popular final payloads delivered by eCrime adversaries using COVID-19-related lures.
WHO did not send these emails, please read this security alert
[who.int] for more information.
On April 14, 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence observed a spam campaign distributing Hancitor using a COVID-19-themed lure and Microsoft Excel 4.0 macro documents.
The emails purported to be an “invoice message” related to a recent purchase of a COVID-19 protection plan with a link providing additional details.
While this is not the first time Hancitor operators have been observed using a COVID-19-themed lure, it is the first time Excel 4.0 macro documents have been used.
Similar to past campaigns, Hancitor continues to download final payloads of Pony and CRE Stealer.
A new malicious Microsoft Office Word document was identified:
The translation is: “UN promised assistance to Kyrgyzstan in the fight against coronavirus.rtf.”
This file displays Russian-language decoy content related to the Kyrgyzstan government’s response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, copied from an April 6, 2020, press release posted on the official government of Kyrgyzstan website www.president[.]kg .
This document delivers the Chinozy malware associated with an activity cluster tracked by CrowdStrike as StrangeVantage.
Similar StrangeVantage activity has been observed by CrowdStrike Intelligence as recently as mid-March 2020.
While this activity cluster is currently unattributed, it is assessed with moderate confidence as likely to be associated with China-nexus targeted intrusion operations.
Observed Activity Update: Monday, April 13
On April 9, 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence identified a phishing email using the spoofed sender alias WHO , referring to the World Health Organization (WHO), which contained the subject “URGENT COVID-19 SUSPECTED AFFECTED VSL”.
The World Health Organization (WHO) did not send this email, please read this security alert
[who.int] for more information.
CrowdStrike Intelligence has recently observed an unattributed targeted intrusion activity cluster using Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and Southeast Asia focused lures and themes to distribute the Chinoxy malware implant in March 2020.
This activity is tracked by CrowdStrike Intelligence under the StrangeVantage activity cluster; while currently unattributed, CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that the StrangeVantage activity cluster is likely associated with Chinese-nexus targeted intrusion operations.
On March 17, 2020, the malicious document “President discusses budget savings due to coronavirus with Finance Minister.rtf” was submitted to a third-party virus scanning service.
Following this submission, several malicious documents with Malaysian-language government decoy and lure content were also identified.
While all three documents use vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Equation editor to deploy the Chinoxy implant, there are slight differences in execution and persistence mechanisms.
CrowdStrike Intelligence has identified incidents involving the likely malicious use of a publicly available penetration testing tool named Octopus.
This tool is available on GitHub and is intended for use in legitimate red team operations.
Octopus is a modular tool and includes functionality that allows users to carry out a range of actions on a victim machine.
Identified incidents indicate malicious actors have likely been using Octopus since at least early 2020.
CrowdStrike assesses it is highly likely this tool will continue to be used in malicious activity due to its public availability and functionality.
Follow-on research into malicious incidents using Octopus led CrowdStrike Intelligence to identify an Octopus PowerShell agent linked to network infrastructure associated with other malicious files.
This Octopus agent was configured to communicate with the C2 IP address 212.71.248[.]46.
This IP address has also served as a C2 for two other files: a Microsoft Word document with malicious macros and a malicious executable which has yet to be identified.
The malicious document is named COVID-19 SAFETY TIPS.docm and contains a PowerShell Empire-based malicious macro.
On March 26, 2020, public reporting identified multiple Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)- themed mobile threats targeting Android-based mobile users.
CrowdStrike Intelligence has analyzed a number of these threats, including AdoBot and Cerberus, which aim to take advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Observed Activity Update: Monday, April 6
On March 27, 2020, a COVID-19-themed phishing campaign with the subject “COVID-19 UPDATE !!”
was sent to victims, purportedly from the World Health Organization (WHO), with a malicious attachment named “ Covid-19_UPDATE_PDF.7z .”
The 7-zip archive contained an executable sample of the information-stealing malware LokiBot (CSIT-17123).
T he World Health Organization (WHO) did not send this email; please read this security alert
[who.int] for more information.
On March 30, 2020, an unattributed adversary sent a phishing message using the spoofed sender alias CDC Health Alert , referring to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which contained the subject “CDC-INFO-Corona Virus Viccine found.”
The message included an attached Gzip archive named “ Covid-19 Vaccine.gz .”
This archive contains the commodity NanoCore RAT, which is widely available in the criminal underground.
On March 31, 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence identified a second email impersonating the CDC to deliver NanoCore.
The message body was apparently derived from a publication on the official CDC website.
Instead of leveraging an attachment to deliver NanoCore, this email prompts recipients to “ download the vaccine” from a Microsoft OneDrive link.
The message body additionally advises victims to contact a UK phone number if needed: “ If you have more question please sms or Whatsapp me on: [UK phone number] on how to use the Vaccine.”
The use of a contact number is not common in criminal spam campaigns .
A lure website referencing COVID-19 (masry-corona[.]com) was identified in use during March 2020 by distributors of the Culebra Variant information stealer to attract internet visitors.
The malware is commonly used to capture Latin-America-based banking customers’ credentials.
AgentTesla continued its capitalization on the COVID-19 pandemic by distributing a spam campaign purportedly from Group Life and Health with the subject “Important Notice to Our Corporate Clients & Partners – COVID -19.”
The spam email contained the RAR archive attachment named “ COVID-19 Communication to corporate Clients..rar .”
The archive file contained an executable file named “ COVID-19 Communication to corporate Clients..exe .”
This executable is a sample of AgentTesla that communicates with the command-and-control (C2) server rajalakshmi[.]co.in .
CrowdStrike Intelligence has obtained several Korean-language exploit documents themed with information pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Korea (ROK).
Upon execution, these documents attempt to deliver two previously unobserved payloads.
The exploit used in this activity and the targeting of individuals likely in the ROK is congruent with previously observed Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) operations; however, the payloads do not have any direct technical overlaps with tools used by any tracked DPRK adversaries.
CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses with moderate confidence that it is likely that these exploit documents were deployed by a DPRK-aligned group but does not attribute this new activity to a named adversary at the time of this writing.
Observed Activity Update: Monday, March 30
CrowdStrike Intelligence identified scam emails spoofing the World Health Organization (WHO) with requests for financial donations to the COVID-19 Solidarity Relief Fund.
The emails copy legitimate communications from WHO regarding the fund, but list an adversary-controlled Bitcoin (BTC) wallet address for payment.
T he World Health Organization (WHO) did not send this email; please read this security alert
[who.int] for more information.
A malicious website (corona-virus-map[.]net) posing as a COVID-19 map was identified dropping SCULLY SPIDER’s DanaBot banking trojan.
The web inject primarily targeted U.S.-based financial institutions.
On March 23, 2020, CrowdStrike Intelligence obtained a phishing message impersonating a U.S. government agency and using the subject line “COVID-19 – nCoV – Special Update – WHO.”
The message contained an attachment named “covid-19 – ncov – special update.doc.”
When opened, this file exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Equation Editor and subsequently issues a GET request to download a file located at http[:]//getegroup[.]com/file.exe that leads to a WarZone remote access tool (RAT) sample.
This malware uses phantom101.duckdns[.]org for command and control.
WarZone is a commercially available RAT commonly used by cybercriminals.
On March 23, 2020, a COVID-19-themed DNS hijacking campaign was identified that reportedly attempts to trick users into downloading Oski Stealer.
By altering the DNS settings for D-Link and Linksys routers, users are directed to an actor-controlled site that claims WHO has released a COVID-19 information application.
Compromised versions of an Android application called “SM_Covid19” are being distributed to unsuspecting users.
The hijacked versions allow for the download and execution of additional malicious code on a user’s device.
The original app was developed by an Italy-based company to assist with applying social-distancing protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic.
CrowdStrike Intelligence identified a malicious Microsoft Office exploit document with Mongolian-language lure content uploaded to a third-party file-scanning service.
When opened, the document displays decoy content bearing Mongolian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) letterhead, related to a COVID-19 press release by the People’s Republic of China (PRC).
CrowdStrike Intelligence currently assesses there is an even chance this activity is associated with the KARMA PANDA (aka MysticChess) adversary.
Further retrospective analysis has also identified suspected KARMA PANDA activity as early as December 2019.
CrowdStrike Intelligence identified a COVID-19-themed lure document being used by VELVET CHOLLIMA to deliver its Konni implant.
The file, titled “Keep an eye on North Korean cyber.doc,” uses macros in an attempt to contact C2 infrastructure.
VELVET CHOLLIMA has used COVID-19-themed documents several times over the past few weeks and is likely taking advantage of this significant geopolitical event to entice its targets to open malicious documents and execute its malware.
Unspecified actors repeatedly targeted the website of Mexico’s official news agency, Notimex, and posted false information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic using the organization’s hijacked social media accounts.
The Notimex website and social media account were restored as of March 23, 2020.
Observed Activity Update: Monday, March 23
On March 23, 2020, public reporting announced that some European-based hospitals had fallen victim to a Netwalker ransomware (aka KazKavKovKiz, Mailto, Mailto2 and KoKo) incident.
The incident reportedly began on March 22, 2020, and used Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) lures.
Throughout March 2020, the RedLine information stealer has used COVID-19-themed spam purportedly originating from a project that simulates potential cures for diseases to evaluate their effectiveness.
A new TrickBot dynamic web inject was distributed targeting customers of Italy-based financial institutions.
It is highly likely that this is a continuation of efforts by WIZARD SPIDER to capitalize on COVID-19 — the group has used COVID-19-themed lures during distribution.
The new dynamic web inject is likely seeking to exploit the inevitable increase in online banking by Italian users during the current lockdown conditions.
On March 16, 2020, the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) reported a text phishing scam claiming to offer advice on local COVID-19 testing facilities.
Interacting with the URL within the text dropped the commodity banking trojan Cerberus via a malicious Android application package.
A Nemty ransomware (v2.6) sample was detected on March 18, 2020, targeting a government entity.
The lure email spoofed the chief executive office of a healthcare organization and referenced an annual general meeting purportedly scheduled to discuss the pandemic.
On March 18, 2020, TWISTED SPIDER announced it will refrain from infecting medical organizations until the pandemic situation stabilizes.
Other criminal actors are also reported to be avoiding infections of healthcare sector entities.
CrowdStrike Intelligence has observed ongoing MUSTANG PANDA activity since late February 2020 using lure content related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Observed incidents have used malicious shortcut files (LNK) to drop decoy documents in Chinese, English and Vietnamese.
CrowdStrike Intelligence anticipates that hacktivism, particularly in Latin America and Europe, is likely to spike during the global COVID-19 pandemic, judging from hacktivist operations over the past week.
During the past year, rates of hacktivism in Latin America have already been higher than normal, due mostly to political unrest in much of the region.
These campaigns are likely to increase as other protest options narrow, given that widespread demonstrations and other large gatherings are increasingly prohibited in order to slow the spread of the virus.

As Kentucky does its best to battle the spread of COVID-19, state officials and medical providers have been looking for ways to answer the increasing need for medical personal protective equipment.
One of those responding in a big way here in Kentucky is a somewhat unlikely source: Somerset Community College.
Somerset Community College was the first higher education institution in Kentucky to offer a statewide certificate in additive manufacturing, also called 3D printing, and thanks to the passion of Additive Manufacturing Professor Eric Wooldridge and Rural Business Development Grants in both fiscal year 2017 and 2019, the program has earned a reputation as a leader in the state in 3D printing education and technical assistance.
Here in Kentucky, parts manufacturers in both the aircraft and automobile industries are big employers, and additive manufacturing–and the associated jobs–is growing across those as well as many other industries because it has a number of advantages over traditional manufacturing.
Eric told me one of those is the ability to quickly transition between products.
In fact, it only took a few hours to go from printing student projects to printing and assembling the first face shield prototypes, and when there was a requested design change, an updated prototype was ready in less than 20 minutes with finished versions coming out within the hour.
Now that they have a finalized design, they are printing and assembling over 100 face shields per hour.
Eric, who is basically living out of his office to continue the process 24/7 with the help of some rotating staff members, said they’ve also shared the specifications with networked additive manufacturers so they could also begin production.
This rapid response to a supply chain shortcoming is just another advantage of additive manufacturing.
“We couldn’t be doing this without the support of the National Science Foundation and Rural Development,” Wooldridge told me.
“NSF and Rural Development grants were essential in getting the equipment and materials and training people how to use it all.”
At Rural Development, our mission is to improve the economy and way of life in rural America, and partners like Somerset Community College remind me there are good stories like this all across this great country.
Time and again, when America is united in attaining a common goal, we band together, and that is part and parcel to rural culture.
Whether it’s family helping family or neighbor helping neighbor, rural America knows that together, America prospers.
A pair of new studies in Nature Communications discuss long COVID, with a Norwegian study finding similar rates after infection with the Delta and Omicron variants in adults, and a Swiss study identifying low socioeconomic status and chronic conditions such as asthma as risk factors for persistent symptoms among teens.
Fatigue, shortness of breath
Norwegian Institute of Public Health researchers led a study of 1,323,145 people aged 18 to 70 years living in Norway who tested positive (57,727) or negative (105,297) for COVID-19.
The team analyzed data from the Nordic National register, which is based on medical records of healthcare services available to all residents.
Participants with Omicron infections (13,365 people) were generally younger, more highly educated, had fewer underlying illnesses, and were more often vaccinated than those with Delta cases (23,767).
Among uninfected participants and those not tested, 17.9% and 10.3% tested positive during follow-up and weren't censored in the main analyses and in the sensitivity analyses, respectively.
In the combined groups, 10.9% tested positive and were censored in analyses from the date of a positive test.
The adjusted prevalence of post-infection symptoms was 5 to 250 per 10,000 people and was generally higher for those included in the main analyses (Omicron, Delta, uninfected) than for untested participants included in the sensitivity analyses.
Participants infected with Omicron were at comparable risk of long-COVID symptoms as those with Delta infections 14 to 126 days after diagnosis, including during the acute (14 to 29 days), sub-acute (30 to 89 days), and long COVID (90 days or later) phases.
Symptoms included fatigue, cough, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, anxiety/depression, and brain fog.
Both Delta- and Omicron-infected participants particularly experienced a 20% to 30% higher rate of post-COVID fatigue and a 30% higher rate of shortness of breath, compared with those who tested negative (fatigue hazard ratio [HR], 1.29; shortness of breath HR, 1.29).
Omicron patients, though, had a lower rate of shortness of breath (HR, 0.77).
At 90 or more days, relative to patients with Delta infections, those with Omicron cases had lower odds of reporting any symptom (43 fewer per 10,000 people) and musculoskeletal pain (23 fewer per 10,000).
A symptom analysis implied that 43 fewer Omicron-infected participants per 10,000 would visit their doctor with any symptom, compared with 10,000 with Delta cases.
The death rate during follow-up was low, at 0.07%, 0.05%, and 0.14% for participants infected with Omicron, those with Delta cases, and those who tested negative or weren't tested, respectively.
"Our findings suggest that the acute and sub-acute burden of post-covid complaints on health services is similar for Omicron and Delta," the study authors wrote.
"The chronic burden may be lower for Omicron vs Delta when considering musculoskeletal pain, but not when considering other typical post-covid complaints.
"
Teens with long COVID
In Switzerland, Geneva University Hospitals researchers tested children aged 6 months to 17 years (average age, 10.2 years) who were part of the SEROCoV-KIDS cohort study for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from December 2021 to February 2022, before Omicron became predominant in Geneva.
Parents completed a questionnaire on their child's symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks.
Of 1,034 children from 612 households tested, 55.1% were seropositive (had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies), indicating previous COVID-19 infection.
After adjustment, among seropositive participants, 9.1% had persistent symptoms, compared with 5.0% of those who were seronegative.
Only adolescents were at substantial risk of long-COVID symptoms (8.3% vs 0.0% among 6- to 11-year-olds and 4.2% among those aged 0 to 5 years).
Risk factors for lingering symptoms were older age, having a lower socioeconomic status, and having a chronic health condition, particularly asthma.
Sex was not tied to long COVID symptoms.
Relative to seronegative patients, those who were seropositive more often had symptoms such as abdominal pain, trouble concentrating, loss of smell, runny nose, muscle pain, breathing difficulties, headache, and constipation.
Seronegative children had more anxiety, lower moods, and dermatologic symptoms such as rash.
Only abdominal pain, loss of smell, and constipation, however, were significantly more common in seropositive children.
The authors noted that long COVID could have long-term consequences on health, social, and academic outcomes, which the pandemic has already worsened.
The contribution of lower socioeconomic status to long-COVID prevalence may be explained, they said, by greater exposure to SARS-CoV-2, higher susceptibility to infection, higher rates of underlying illnesses, and healthcare disparities.
"Our findings show that a significant proportion of seropositive children, particularly adolescents, experienced persistent COVID symptoms," the researchers wrote.
"While there is a need for further investigations, growing evidence of pediatric post-COVID urges early screening and primary care management."
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are many reasons why people may consider retiring sooner than they planned.
This could mean claiming your Social Security or pension benefits or tapping into savings earlier than planned.
Below are some resources to help you understand and weigh your options when considering an unexpected retirement.
Claiming Social Security
The age when you start collecting Social Security can make a big difference in the amount you’ll get each month.
For example, you can claim your Social Security retirement benefits as early as age 62, but the amount you receive each month could be 30 percent less than what you’ll receive at your full retirement age or up to 70 percent of what you’re eligible to get at age 70.
If you need to start collecting your benefit early because of your financial situation, here are a few options that can help you maximize your benefit if your plans or employment situation changes.
Withdrawing your application
If you’re able to secure a job or another income source, you have a one-time option to withdraw your application for Social Security benefits as long as it’s within 12 months of when you applied.
Keep in mind, however, that this can be complicated and possibly expensive.
If you already started receiving benefits, you’ll need to repay what you and your family received – and all at once.
Your spouse and any other beneficiaries also must provide written consent to the withdrawal.
Suspending your benefits
If you’ve already reached your full retirement age and you’re financially able to, you can also ask the Social Security Administration to suspend your payments , which will allow your monthly benefit to grow until age 70.
Use our Social Security planning tool to learn more about how your retirement age impacts your benefits and other factors to consider.
Collecting your pension
If you have an employer-provided pension, and a choice between a monthly payment or lump-sum payout, it’s important to think carefully about the tradeoffs of your options and to always ensure that your payout amount is properly calculated.
Weigh your payout options
While pension payments are traditionally paid out monthly, employers are also increasingly offering payments in one lump sum .
While this option may provide more flexibility, it also shifts the responsibility to you to manage and protect the entirety of your retirement money.
Choosing a monthly payment can offer steady and protected income.
However, if you’re considering a lump sum payment, consider a number of important questions around whether you’re at risk of outliving your money or losing or reducing your benefit due to risky investments or fraud.
Detecting calculation errors
Errors can occur when pension administrators calculate your payout amount.
Missing commissions, overtime or bonuses, and outdated personal information are among common errors that could impact the total pension amount .
As a result, it’s important to review your pension plan and to work with your administrator if there’s incorrect information in your employment record.
If you have questions or concerns about your pension, federally-funded and certified pension counselors can provide free advice .
Also, use our comprehensive pension guide to make sure you get the most out of this important financial benefit.
Withdrawing from your 401(k)s and IRAs
If you have access to an employer-provided and tax-deferred retirement plan, like a 401(k) or a traditional Individual Retirement Account (IRA), you may be considering a withdrawal from these accounts to supplement your income.
In general, you can begin withdrawing money from your plan, without penalty, after the age of 59½. However, any withdrawals before this will result in having to pay taxes because this money is considered income.
Your withdrawals could also place you in a higher income tax bracket and may affect your eligibility for other benefits and tax credits.
Finding your money from an old pension or 401(k)
If you worked for multiple employers during your career, you may be one of the millions of people who have left some money behind in retirement accounts and unclaimed pensions.
If you’re unsure, contact your past employer(s) and ask for the plan administrator information to see whether this is a possibility.
If your employer or administrator are out of business, you can get help identifying whether or not you have an existing retirement account by contacting the Employee Benefits Security Administration .
Similarly, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation , which guarantees many large employer pensions, may be able to help you locate an old pension.
Managing expenses
When considering retirement, it’s important to factor in your expenses.
Here are a few to take into consideration as well as resources that may offer support.
Housing
Housing may likely be your largest expense in retirement.
Utility expenses increase as you spend more time at home, and taxes and other home maintenance costs are a concern for many older homeowners.
If you’re among the millions of homeowners carrying a mortgage into retirement, there may be a number of options that can help you reduce your monthly costs, including refinancing, loan modifications, and repayment plans.
Forbearance may be also available if you’re unable to make your monthly payments.
It’s important to contact your mortgage servicer to learn what options are available to you.
If you're concerned about how to pay your mortgage or rent during the current pandemic, we have information on what to do now, and what your options are for mortgage and rental relief.
Some states and localities also offer relief on property tax bills and utilities that can lower housing costs.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development also provides a list of approved housing counseling agencies in your area that can provide free advice on your housing situation.
Health care and other expenses
Finally, you may also be eligible for benefits and discounts that could reduce your regular expenses, especially on health care costs.
These benefits are not only for low-income adults; many are based on age or the type of income you receive.
Find out if you’re eligible for benefits programs available in your area .
Our Vision and Mission
Grounded in a vision of a planet protected from human suffering and the devastating social and economic consequences of COVID-19, we, an initial group of global health actors (BMGF, CEPI, Gavi, Global Fund, UNITAID, Wellcome Trust, WHO) and private sector partners and other stakeholders, are launching a landmark, global and time-limited collaboration to accelerate the development, production and equitable global access to new COVID-19 essential health technologies.
We know that as long as anyone is at risk from this virus, the entire world is at risk – every single person on the planet needs to be protected from this disease.
We agree that alongside evidence-based public health measures, innovative COVID-19 diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines are needed – in record time and at record scale and access – to save millions of lives and countless trillions of dollars, and to return the world to a sense of ‘normalcy’.
We recognize the significant amount of critical work, investment and initiatives already ongoing around the world to expedite the development and deployment of innovative COVID-19 related products and interventions.
We appreciate that while development and deployment of innovative products is essential, it will not be enough.
We must simultaneously and urgently accelerate the strengthening of sustainable health systems and capacities to enable delivery of the new COVID-19 tools to those who need them and to mitigate the knock-on impact on other diseases.
We remember lessons from the past, which have shown that even when effective tools are available to the world, too often some are protected, while others are not.
This inequity is unacceptable – all tools to address COVID-19 must be available to all.
In the fight against COVID-19, no one should be left behind.
We understand we cannot do this alone, and that we need to work together in unprecedented and inclusive partnership with all stakeholders – political leaders, public and private sector partners, civil society, academia, and all other stakeholders across society – jointly leveraging our comparative strengths and respective voices to drive towards collective solutions, an accelerated path, and access for all.
We are stronger, faster and more effective working together.
Our Mission is not only accelerated development and availability of new COVID-19 tools – it is to accelerate equitable global access to safe, quality, effective, and affordable COVID-19 diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines, and thus to ensure that in the fight against COVID-19, no one is left behind.
Our Commitment
We commit to the shared aim of equitable global access to innovative tools for COVID-19 for all.
We commit to an unprecedented level of partnership – proactively engaging stakeholders, aligning and coordinating efforts, building on existing collaborations, collectively devising solutions, and grounding our partnership in transparency, and science.
We commit to create a strong unified voice to maximize impact, recognizing this is not about singular decision-making authority, but rather collective problem-solving, interconnectedness and inclusivity, where all stakeholders can connect and benefit from the expertise, knowledge and activities of this shared action-oriented platform.
We commit to build on past experiences towards achieving this objective, including ensuring that every activity we undertake is executed through the lens of equitable global access, and that the voices of the communities most affected are heard.
We commit to be accountable to the world, to communities, and to one another.
We are coming together in the spirit of solidarity, and in the service of humanity, to achieve our mission and vision.
Our Call
We ask the global community and political leaders to support this landmark collaboration, and for donors to provide the necessary resources to accelerate achievement of the objectives of this global collaboration, capitalizing on the opportunity provided by the rolling pledging campaign that will start on 4 May 2020.
If you have diabetes, you are no more likely to catch coronavirus (COVID-19) than anyone else.
However people with diabetes are more vulnerable to developing a severe illness if they do get coronavirus, but the way it affects you can vary from person to person.
All the coronavirus information below applies to the whole of the UK, unless specified.
We've noted where are some differences in guidance and diabetes services across the UK.
How coronavirus can affect people with diabetes
The majority of people who do get coronavirus – whether they have diabetes or not – will have mild symptoms and don’t need to go into hospital.
However, everyone with diabetes, including those with type 1, type 2, gestational and other types, is more vulnerable to developing a severe illness if they do get coronavirus.
This is why people living with diabetes are classed as being in a 'clinical risk group' for the coronavirus vaccines.
In adults with diabetes, there are certain factors that increase risk of serious illness like being older, having a high HbA1c, or having a history of diabetes-related complications.
There are other factors too, like your BMI and ethnicity, that research shows can have an impact on your risk.
In children with diabetes, the risk of becoming seriously ill with coronavirus is very low.
There are some risk factors that you can't change, but others where you can reduce your risk.
Being ill can make your blood sugar go all over the place.
Your body tries to fight the illness by releasing stored glucose (sugar) into your blood stream to give you energy.
But your body can’t produce enough or any insulin to cope with this, so your blood sugars rise.
Your body is working overtime to fight the illness, making it harder to manage your diabetes.
This means you’re more at risk of having serious blood sugar highs and lows, potentially leading to DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis) or HHS (hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state).
How to reduce your risk of getting seriously ill from coronavirus
Research shows that having the vaccine reduces the risk of getting seriously ill with coronavirus.
There are some things that can help you keep safe:
get your coronavirus vaccines and booster when you are eligible
wash your hands regularly, for 20 seconds
keep indoor spaces well ventilated and opt for meeting outdoors, where possible
wear a face covering in enclosed spaces, if not exempt.
Lateral flow tests
Rapid lateral flow tests are available to encourage people to test themselves regularly.
You can buy rapid lateral flow tests from a pharmacy.
The government has produced a step-by-step guide for people with visual impairment, on how to use and return your test kits.
Managing your blood glucose (sugar) levels
Research has shown that having a high HbA1c can increase your risk of becoming seriously ill from coronavirus.
So it’s important to work with your diabetes team to try to bring your blood sugar levels to a healthy range.
Getting the coronavirus vaccines
People living with diabetes are classed as being in a 'clinical risk group' for coronavirus vaccination because they are more at risk of becoming seriously ill from coronavirus.
The most important way people living with diabetes can lower this risk is to avoid catching the virus in the first place.
A vaccine is the most effective way to prevent infection and that’s why we strongly encourage you to get the vaccine.
Anyone aged 5 or over can get a first and second dose of the coronavirus vaccine.
And now anyone over 50 and people with diabetes aged 5 and over will be offered a booster dose this autumn.
Get more information about the coronavirus vaccines, including who can get it and how safe it is for people with diabetes.
The government has also released an easy-read guide about the booster vaccinations.
"There have been lots of myths about the vaccine in the South Asian community.
But I’ve had the vaccine, my 98-year-old dad has had it and we’re both fine – and you will be too.
And it means you can make sure you and your family are safe."

NHS Covid Pass
You may be asked to prove your vaccination status before you can enter large venues and events using an NHS COVID Pass.
To get an NHS Covid Pass, you will need to download and register your details on the NHS App if you are in England or Wales, the NHS Scotland Covid Status App or the Northern Ireland Covidcert NI app.
Find out more about Getting an NHS COVID Pass.
Face masks and coverings
Face coverings are no longer required by law in any setting, although some businesses, transport providers and supermarkets are asking their staff and customers to continue to wear one.
Public health guidance remains in place, suggesting people should continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces, where you may come into contact with people you don't normally meet.
Staff and children in secondary schools are not required to wear masks in classrooms.
We support the continued wearing of face masks for people with diabetes or anyone who wants to.
Wearing a mask helps keep you and others safe and is a simple way to reduce your risk as you go about your daily life.
We hope employers across the UK continue to be considerate of the wellbeing of their employees and consider the benefits of encouraging face masks within their premises.
There are certain reasons why some people don’t need to wear a face covering – called exemptions.
These include children (depending on their age), if you have asthma, and other reasons.
If you get coronavirus
If you do get coronavirus, it’s really important that you follow your sick day rules.
This will help you to keep your blood sugars in range as much as possible, so you can stay well and fight the virus.
We know it’s not that always that simple.
Take a look at our new courses in Learning Zone to help you remember your sick day rules and manage your blood sugar levels, and our guide on staying home and managing diabetes.
Some people are being treated for coronavirus with a steroid called dexamethasone, which can make your blood sugars go high.
Find out more about the steroid dexamethasone and diabetes.
Remember, for urgent medical help, call 999.
"I’m just trying not to worry too much.
I think it’s a case of taking precautions and following the government guidelines, as well as doing my very best to look after my health.

How coronavirus can affect children with diabetes
Children typically have mild symptoms if they catch the virus.
We are not aware of any children with diabetes who have died from coronavirus.
However, as with all people with diabetes, an illness like coronavirus can make it harder to manage your child’s diabetes and the risk of DKA will be higher when they are unwell.
A vaccine is the most effective way to prevent getting ill from coronavirus and that's why we strongly encourage anyone who is eligible to get the vaccine - this includes children aged 5 years and above.
How coronavirus can affect pregnancy and diabetes
The same rules apply to you as for everyone with diabetes.
If you’re pregnant and have diabetes, then you are not more at risk of getting the virus.
However, if you do get the virus, you could be more at risk of developing complications and it could become harder to manage your diabetes.
It's important you know how to reduce your risk, which includes getting the vaccines.
You can find all the latest information on the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists website.
How coronavirus can affect people in type 2 diabetes remission
Diabetes remission works differently for different people, and we still don't know enough about it.
So we don't know for sure how the virus could affect you if you’re in remission.
Everyone, including people in diabetes remission, should know how to reduce their risk of getting coronavirus, including getting the vaccines.
You can find more general information in our guide to type 2 diabetes remission.
How coronavirus can affect people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups
The risk of death from coronavirus for some ethnic groups is higher than for people of white ethnicity.
But it is important to remember that there are lots of factors involved, like age, and overall risk of dying from coronavirus is very low.
In England and Wales, data from the Office of National Statistics shows how people from certain Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups are more at risk than people of white ethnicity.
Research in Scotland hasn’t shown this increased risk, but the BAME population there is very small.
And we don’t have data on this in Northern Ireland at the moment.
Data from Office of National Statistics.
Covid-19 deaths by ethnicity in England and Wales between 2 March and 10 April 2020.
We don’t know why this is happening.
The data takes into account factors which we know can increase risk, such as age, socioeconomic status and health, including obesity.
And we do know that some ethnic minority groups are more at risk of developing conditions like type 2 diabetes and heart problems, which are linked to increased risk of death from coronavirus.
It’s clear that we need further research to understand what’s causing this – whether the causes are physical, cultural or social.
Can coronavirus cause diabetes?
There is mixed evidence to suggest that coronavirus might be triggering diabetes in some people, or making the condition worse for others.
We've taken a look at the research so far and explain what scientists are doing to find answers.
Long COVID
Long COVID is used to describe signs and symptoms that last for a few weeks or months after having a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19.
It can affect your whole body, and your symptoms can change and come and go over time.
If you think you might have Long COVID, the first thing you should do is speak to your GP.
They will look into your symptoms and first try to find out if there are any other possible causes.
Treatment of Long COVID or COVID fatigue will depend on how long you have been experiencing these symptoms.
Treatment is often focused on managing the symptoms and this can vary from person to person.
Some research studies have suggested that having diabetes could make you more likely to develop Long COVID, but it’s too early to know for sure yet.
The government has pledged £18.5 million to fund research to better understand and treat the longer-term effects of coronavirus.
These projects will help us better understand if diabetes is a risk factor for Long COVID.
Managing both the symptoms of Long COVID and your diabetes may be difficult but make sure you're aware of your sick day rules and take each day as it comes.
This can be a difficult time and we are here for you.
Going to work
Wherever you live in the UK, your employer must make sure your workplace is safe – this means doing a risk assessment at work.
We know that some people with diabetes don't feel safe going to work, so we have been calling on the government and employers to make it safer.
If you have concerns about your safety at work, we've got more information about your rights in our diabetes and work guide.
Going to appointments or into hospital
If you have coronavirus symptoms, do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital even if you have an appointment.
If you're already having treatment for something like a foot or eye problem, and you don't have coronavirus symptoms, then your appointments should still carry on.
If you're worried about going to your clinic or hospital at this time or want to check whether your appointment is still going ahead, call the number on your appointment letter or speak to your GP.
Some of your appointments with your diabetes healthcare team may be on the phone or online, using a video call.
Your diabetes healthcare team will give you advice on the best type of appointment for you at this time.
Having a phone or video appointment might feel strange if you're not used to it but we've got advice on preparing for a remote appointments.
Most routine appointments like your annual diabetes review that had been delayed or postponed should be going back to normal.
In the meantime, follow your current routine including checking your feet daily, keep to a healthy diet and try to keep active.
Eye screening is still going ahead in some circumstances and for some people who are at higher risk of problems, such as pregnant women with diabetes.
All eye screening clinics should be using personal protective equipment (PPE).
And remember to get your free flu jab as early as possible.
Speak to your GP or go to your local pharmacy.
Find out more about the flu jab.
If you are invited to an in-person appointment it’s very important to attend unless you develop coronavirus symptoms.
"Flu increases the risk of needing to go into hospital for people with diabetes so we must do all we can to keep protected against flu this year.
That's why the free NHS flu jab is so important.
"
- Dan Howarth, our Head of Care and Diabetes Specialist Nurse
If you spot something new you're concerned about, like a cut or blister on your foot, call your GP and explain your situation.
If you can't get through, call 111 for advice.
If you have any change in your vision you should contact your local screening service or optometrist.
You may be in a situation where you need medical attention – this may be something related to your diabetes, or it may be something unrelated like an injury or illness.
This means you might have to go to the Accident and Emergency (A&E) department of your local hospital and you might have to wait a while before being seen.
During this time, your care in hospital may be a little different to normal, for example you may not see the diabetes team or not have family with you when you go into hospital.
For any problem, regardless of the current situation, you should go to hospital as you would've done before – the NHS is still open.
Read our guide to managing your diabetes while in hospital.

Confirms 2,239 Additional Coronavirus Cases in New York State - Bringing Statewide Total to 321,192; New Cases in 41 Counties
SAN DIEGO — USBP San Diego Sector (SDC) is strengthening its presence along California’s coastline in an effort to curb illegal human and drug smuggling routes being exploited by transnational criminal organizations.
This effort concurrently prevents further introduction of COVID-19 into California communities.
Maritime smuggling has become common place along the Pacific coastline and SDC is proactively addressing the growing threat.
Fiscal year to date, SDC Border Patrol has recorded 129 maritime events, which led to 485 arrests and the seizure of nearly 6,642 pounds of illegal drugs.
This is compared to fiscal year 2019, when agents recorded 194 maritime events, which led to 660 arrests and more than 19,000 pounds of seized contraband.
Criminal organizations that exploit our Pacific border often use overloaded vessels that are not equipped to handle rough, ocean waters.
The vessels also lack legally required safety lighting, are overcrowded with cargo and/or people, and have inferior engine and fuel compartments.
These smuggling attempts often turn into rescue missions that require additional USBP assets as well as assets from other local first responders.
As an example, one February 2020 maritime event turned into a significant rescue operation.
To deter the illegal maritime events from occurring, SDC is deploying additional patrol units to the coastal border.
This will include the use of the sector’s Horse Patrol Unit (HPU), which has been utilized since USBP’s inception.
Nationwide, these units allow agents to patrol rugged terrain that is not easily accessible via 4x4 vehicles or ATV’s.
SDC’s official area of responsibility extends along the entire coast of California and includes areas that are difficult to access, which can hinder response times.
With the deployment of HPU along the coastal areas, SDC will increase its ability to interdict maritime smuggling events and curb the spread of COVID-19.
If you have information about maritime smuggling or suspicious activity along the coast of California, please call 9-1-1, and you will be directed through the proper channels.
Participants
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Friuli Centrale (Prot.
N. 0016723/P/GEN/ARCS)
and carried out in accordance with the 2013 Fortaleza version of the Helsinki Declaration and subsequent amendments.
All subjects were informed about the aim of the study and gave their written informed consent prior to inclusion.
A sample of 113 (out of 130 contacted and who did not want to take part to the study) Italian adults among patients with a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 infection at the Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Friuli Centrale (ASUFC, Udine, Italy) was initially included in this study.
Participants were split into two groups: patients who had OD + GD and patients who did not.
In the first part of the study, before they were administered mental imagery questionnaires, participants completed a questionnaire to collect information about: (i) their age, gender, years of education, handedness, city of residence and occupation; (ii) smoking status (non-smokers or previous smokers and, in the latter case, time since smoking cessation; (iii) information on possible causes of exclusion (see section on exclusion criteria).
We asked them about: (i) the date they had tested positive for COVID-19, and the date they were re-tested and were found to be negative; (ii) whether they had GD/OD, and, if so, whether they experienced a decrease, alteration or loss of sensations.
Finally, in patients who had suffered of OD + GD, we asked if these symptoms were still present, or their duration, in case of recovery.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Subjects meeting the following criteria were included in the study: (i) positive test for COVID-19; (ii) age between 18 and 75; and (iii) informed consent to participate in the study.
Subjects meeting one or more of the following criteria were excluded from the study (see also Fig. 1): (i) known congenital structural anomalies of the Central Nervous System (CNS) such as cerebral or cerebrovascular malformations; (ii) known acquired structural lesions of the CNS, such as ischemic, traumatic events, brain tumors, in particular olfactory groove meningioma, or outcomes of neurosurgery interventions; (iii) known neurocognitive developmental deficits; (iv) conditions associated with changes in taste and smell, in particular allergic or viral rhinitis, exposure to organic solvents, HIV infections, Sjögren syndrome, states of malnutrition with zinc deficiency, neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea, Parkinson's disease, Pick's disease, multiple system atrophy), genetic diseases (Down, Klinefelter, and Kallmann syndromes); (v) concomitant diabetes mellitus; (vi) concomitant pharmacological therapies (especially: beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, anti-depressants, antibiotics, antifungals, methotrexate, chemotherapy); (vii) smoking behaviour.

Paradigm and tasks
We used four questionnaires taken from the published literature and two additional experimental questionnaires developed specifically for the study.
All questionnaires were self-assessment measures.
Self-assessment of taste and odor perception
The patients’ level of flavor, taste and odor perception at the time of testing was assessed by the following two ratings.
Self-assessment questionnaires, flavor and taste score36
Patients were asked to rate their current chemosensory function, namely flavor (“How would you rate your fine taste, e.g., during eating and drinking?”) and taste perception (“How would you rate your basic taste: sweet, sour, salty, bitter?”) by using a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (“no taste/flavor perception”) to 10 (“excellent flavor/taste perception”; Cronbachs Alpha, calculated on our dataset was 0.923).
Self-assessment questionnaires, olfactory score37
Patients were asked to evaluate their sense of smell (“How would you rate your sense of smell?)
by using a nine-point visual analogue scale ranging from 1 (“good sense of smell”) to 9 (“excellent sense of smell”).
Multisensory mental imagery vividness ratings
The following three questionnaires were used to measure the patients’ level of (i) general mental imagery vividness (Plymouth Sensory Imagery Questionnaire38); (ii) vividness of olfactory imagery for different entities, e.g. odors involving food or other perceptible odors in external or internal environments (Vividness of Olfactory Imagery Questionnaire—VOIQ39); (iii) vividness of olfactory and gustatory imagery for food and beverage (designed for the purposes of the present study).
Plymouth sensory imagery questionnaire—Psi-Q38
Psi-Q consists of 7 sub-tests, each including 5 items, one for each sensory modality (visual, auditory, olfactory, taste, touch, bodily sensation, and emotional feeling).
A typical item is ‘Imagine the appearance of…’ (or ‘the sound of…’, ‘the taste of…’, ‘the odor of…’, and so on).
Participants were asked to rate their image on a 10-point scale ranging from 0 (no image at all) to 10 (as vivid as real life).
The Psi-Q allowed verifying the presence of dissociations between imagery in different sensory modalities (taste and/or olfaction vs. other sensory modalities).
All items were summed to a total score, with low values reflecting good odor imagery abilities, and high values representing poor olfactory imagination abilities.
In addition, total values were calculated for each category (Cronbachs Alpha of 0.91).
Vividness of olfactory imagery questionnaire—VOIQ39
VOIQ includes 16 odors belonging to four different categories: personal hygiene (bath), food-related (barbecue), tobacco and vehicles (car).
For each category patients are presented with four sentences and asked to rate the vividness of their imagination on a five-point Likert scale (1 = perfectly realistic and as vivid as the real odor; 5 = No odor at all, you only “know” that you are thinking of an odor).
All items were summed to a total score, with low values reflecting good odor imagery abilities, and high values representing poor olfactory imagination abilities.
In addition, total values were calculated for each category (Split-half reliability 0.858).
Olfactory and taste mental imagery of food and beverages
We created a list of 40 words of food and drinks inspired by the list published in The FoodCast research image database40 presented in Appendix 1.
Patients were explicitly asked to imagine the odor and evaluate the vividness of smell (“How would you rate your vividness of smell?) by using a 6-point visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (“No odor at all, you only “know” that you are thinking of an odor”) to 5 (“perfectly realistic and as vivid as the real odor”, Cronbachs Alpha, calculated on our dataset was 0.988).
Additionally, in a second questionnaire, they were explicitly asked to imagine the taste and to evaluate the vividness of taste (“How would you rate your vividness of taste?) by using a 11-point visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (“No taste at all, you only “know” that you are thinking of a taste”) to 10 (“perfectly realistic and as vivid as the real taste”, Cronbachs Alpha, calculated on our dataset was 0.987).
Data acquisition
In addition to patients' responses to the above questionnaires, we collected demographic information, such as gender, age, area of residence, education and manual dominance41 were collected electronically.
We also collected important data on patients’ current or previous smoke habits: these last factors, although not considered among the exclusion criteria, were taken into account during the process of data analysis, representing possible non infective causes of altered taste and smell.
Sample size calculation
An a-priori analysis was conducted using G*Power42 to test differences between the means of two independent groups using t-test (two-tailed), a size average effect (d = 0.65), and the alpha of 0.05 and an expected ratio of 2:1 between the groups.
Based on the results, a sample size of 86 participants was required to obtain a power of 0.80.
Data analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois), version 20.0.
The characteristics of the study population were described using means and standard deviation for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables.
Data was tested for normal distribution using the Shapiro–Wilk test.
Variables did not fulfil requirements for parametric testing.
Statistics for research question 1
Subjective self-ratings for taste and odor perception were compared between the OD + GD vs the non OD + GD groups.
Mann–Whitney U-test was used to compare continuous variables between groups.
Comparison of categorical variables was performed by Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate.
Lastly, in order to analyze the relationship between variables, we choose an appropriate measure of association, using Kendall’s coefficient of rank correlation (if one variable was continuous and the other one was ordinal, or when both variables were ordinal), or, alternatively, point-biserial correlation coefficient (when one variable was continuous and the other was nominal, with two categories).
For these correlation analyses we corrected for multiple comparisons by using Bonferroni correction.
Statistics for research question 2
Psi-Q, VOIQ, gustatory and olfactory mental imagery of food and beverages scores were compared between the OD + GD vs the non OD + GD groups.
Mann–Whitney U-test was used to compare continuous variables between groups.
Comparison of categorical variables was performed by Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate.
Lastly, in order to analyze the relationship between variables, we choose an appropriate measure of association, using Kendall’s coefficient of rank correlation (if one variable was continuous and the other one was ordinal, or when both variables were ordinal), or, alternatively, point-biserial correlation coefficient (when one variable was continuous and the other was nominal, with two categories).
For these correlation analyses we corrected for multiple comparisons by using Bonferroni correction.

Unlike most industries during COVID-19, plastic manufacturers are seeing production increase in the midst of a global economic downturn.
“Domestically for us, plastic has remained pretty strong.
Demand has probably increased,” said Joshua Baca, vice president of the American Chemistry Council’s Plastics Division.
But that growth also means more plastic in landfills — a problem, according to environmental advocates, who say that corporate efforts to curb waste, including a stated goal of recycling all plastic packaging by 2040, are insufficient.
“Pour money into it; build it; it’ll all get recycled — that’s the myth they’re promoting,” Ivy Schlegel, a plastics researcher with the environmental advocacy group Greenpeace, told FRONTLINE.
Production of plastic resins, the building blocks of all plastic products, increased 0.9 percent in the U.S. in 2020, compared to 1.2 percent in 2019.
Despite smaller growth than the previous year, plastic was the only segment of the U.S. chemistry industry, which includes everything from fertilizer to synthetic rubber, to expand last year, according to a year-end report by the American Chemistry Council.
The report projects that plastics will be the fastest-growing part of the industry through 2030, factoring in economic recovery, the anticipated end of the pandemic and other variables.
Industry analysts attribute American plastic’s continued growth to increased consumer demand and to its designation as “essential” in responding to COVID-19.
Plastic’s stability is also due, in part, to public perception of it as resistant to COVID-19 transmission.
Masks, gloves and other protective equipment are made from plastics; so are the delivery cartons, soda bottles and other single-use packaging that Americans used and discarded as they ordered more food and consumer goods delivered to their homes.
“We don’t have a plastics problem,” Baca of the American Chemistry Council said, citing the pandemic-era rise of plastic shopping bags, masks and syringes.
“We have a plastic waste problem.”
The early days of COVID-19, when attention was focused on potential spread from surfaces, proved to be a particular boon for plastic bags.
Cities and states across America rolled back or postponed bag bans amid fears that reusable grocery bags could harbor the virus.
In California, which used 500 million single-use plastic bags per month before voters approved a ban in 2016, Gov. Gavin Newsome suspended the state’s plastic-bag ban from late April to late June 2020.
“[Plastic industry executives] were misusing a lot of studies to make people afraid and think they were going to contract coronavirus and die from bringing reusable bags to the store,” Greenpeace’s Schlegel said.
While some cities and states across the U.S. have passed local restrictions on plastic bags and polystyrene food containers, broad bans on single-use plastic remain hotly contested.
A California bill that would have sharply restricted the use of non-recyclable plastic was defeated in September, following a multimillion-dollar lobbying campaign by the plastics industry.
Baca said that enhanced recycling is the way to fix plastic waste, not bans on single-use plastics.
“It’s just a short-sighted solution that doesn’t address the problem.”
Schlegel disagreed, saying that less plastic — not just more recycling — is needed to stop waste buildup: “We think the ACC is overstating the simplicity.”
In the March 2020 documentary Plastic Wars, FRONTLINE and NPR investigated the plastic industry’s response to ballooning waste.
Correspondent Laura Sullivan reviewed internal documents from the late 1980s and early 1990s that showed executives were aware recycling was not likely to solve the plastic-waste problem, even as they launched a public relations campaign touting recycling’s efficacy.
“If the public thinks that recycling is working, then they’re not going to be as concerned about the environment,” Larry Thomas, the former head of the Society of the Plastics Industry, said in the film.
“I think [executives] knew that the infrastructure wasn’t there to really have recycling amount to a whole lot.”
To boost recycling efforts, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste — an industry group of major corporations, including Pepsi, P&G and Shell — has promised to spend $1.5 billion by 2024 to reduce plastic pollution and boost re-use efforts.
And the American Chemistry Council told FRONTLINE it has committed to the re-use or recycling of all plastic packaging by 2040.
But reducing plastic waste isn’t that simple, according to Ron Liesemer, who led the industry’s recycling campaigns in the late 1980s and 1990s.
Back then, the playbook was similar to today, he said: Plastic companies responded to concerns by funding and promoting the recycling of consumer plastics.
But a lot of plastic waste that technically was recyclable — polystyrene foam and PVC containers, food-stained packaging — ended up in landfills, because it was either technologically impossible or too expensive to separate from general waste.
Less than 10 percent of the world’s 6.3 billion tons of plastic waste has been recycled, researchers found in 2017.
“Making recycling work was a way to keep their products in the marketplace,” Liesemer told FRONTLINE and NPR in Plastic Wars.
Major industry players point out that they haven’t used the pandemic to walk back recycling commitments.
Rob Stier, a petrochemical industry analyst at S&P Global Platts, told FRONTLINE that companies including IKEA and Michelin are now buying stakes in their own recycling operations, in an effort to manage costs while increasing recycling capacity.
“The current scale [of plastic recycling] needs to become an order of magnitude larger,” Stier said.
As for emerging methods of recycling explored in Plastic Wars, including using chemicals or heat to break down plastics, “I think a lot of those technologies are still in the demonstration mode,” Stier said.
While corporations explore ways to underwrite costs moving forward, the current American recycling system is in danger of being derailed by the pandemic, said Colin Staub, a reporter for the trade publication Resource Recycling.
Municipal budgets, which pay for recycling collection programs, are likely to suffer in the upcoming fiscal year due to COVID-induced cuts.
In New York, state legislators are attempting to fix the problem by proposing a bill that would require manufacturers to pay for local recycling efforts.
Municipal budget cuts also would hamper efforts to keep recyclable consumer goods out of landfills, according to Staub.
“That’s going to be a huge strain,” he said.
“It is going to have long-term implications for the recycling sector.”

Paul Levine is a survivor.
The retired accountant beat leukemia a few years ago, he has long lived with diabetes, and he managed to make it through a tough case of COVID-19 in the spring.
But after a week at Mount Sinai's Beth Israel Hospital, the 86-year-old New Yorker was desperate to go home.
And go home he did, thanks to the services of Mount Sinai’s hospital-at-home program.
Levine appreciated the visiting nurses, portable oxygen, and many other supports that appeared at his front door.
But he’s sure his wife’s cooking contributed, too.
That’s because he’d lost 20 pounds when the novel coronavirus hijacked his taste buds, and hospital food had not helped.
“I definitely credit some of my recovery to my wife’s amazing mushroom and barley soup,” he says.
The popularity of the hospital-at-home model, first launched in the 1990s in a handful of places, was starting to grow in recent years, but interest in it has skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic, experts say.
Although it’s not right for everyone, it’s easy to see why many patients like the option.
Hospital at home removes the awkward gowns, frequent disruptions, and irksome roommates typical of so many hospital stays.
But the model also has solid science behind it.
One study showed that participants moved around nearly three times more than nonparticipants, a factor that is usually vital to recovery.
It also boosted sleep time, produced fewer readmissions, and reduced mortality rates — all while significantly cutting costs.
“If hospital at home were a drug, everyone would buy it,” says David Levine, MD, MPH, who heads the Brigham and Women’s Hospital program in Boston.
In the age of COVID-19, hospital at home offers additional upsides.
It can help conserve personal protective equipment (PPE), frees up beds during COVID-19 surges, keeps infected people out of hospitals, and addresses patients’ fear of contracting the disease while receiving other care.
“If hospital at home were a drug, everyone would buy it.”

Since the pandemic hit, Mount Sinai has tripled the number of its hospital-at-home participants.
Atrium Health in North Carolina, which launched its program specifically to help COVID-19 patients, has so far cared for more than 17,000 people in their homes.
Bruce Leff, MD, runs a program at Johns Hopkins that advises institutions interested in establishing hospital-at-home programs.
“I used to get maybe 10 calls a month.
Now I get 20 or 30,” he says.
“The field has just exploded.”
A hospital at your doorstep
Not all patients can use hospital at home.
It isn’t appropriate for those who need the intensive care unit, for example, or for people who want or need a nurse just a few steps away.
But it has worked well for such serious ailments as pneumonia, congestive heart failure, diabetes complications, and dangerous skin infections.
Hospital-at-home services vary across the roughly 30 U.S. programs, but they generally include mainstays like blood tests and electrocardiograms — all delivered courtesy of visiting nurses, physicians, or paramedics.
There can also be some patient self-monitoring using simple tools like in-home blood pressure kits.
The Brigham and Women’s program, created with a research grant in 2016, is among the most tech-intensive.
Instead of monitoring patients using the standard vital signs monitor with snaking wires found in hospitals, providers receive the same data via a wireless patch roughly the size of a large Band-Aid.
Attached to the patient’s chest, it constantly transmits helpful information such as heart rate and lung functioning to team members at the hospital.
The patch offers another advantage: It can detect whether the patient has fallen.
“Because of our technology, we’re able to take much sicker patients than we otherwise could,” explains Levine, who receives a computer-generated alert if a patient’s vital signs become concerning.
“We take all sorts of heart conditions,” he says.
“I had a patient who was over 100 years old with a very fast heart rhythm the other day, and we were able to treat her at home.”
Levine and others note that it’s actually the programs’ low-tech features that can have the biggest impact, such as detecting aspects of a patient’s environment or habits that would go unnoticed in the hospital.
“You wonder why Mr. Smith comes back seven times for congestive heart failure when he says he’s taking all his meds.
Then you go to his home and watch him take them, and you see that he doesn’t really understand” the medication regimen, says Linda DeCherrie, MD, clinical director of Mount Sinai’s program.
But what about an at-home emergency?
“We can get help to patients in minutes, whether by sending a paramedic or even someone from our team,” says Levine.
Plus, well-honed criteria help ensure that his program includes only patients at a low risk of major setbacks.
“Yes, we do have very rare events,” he says, “but there are lots of problems associated with being in the hospital, too.”
COVID-19 patient Levine felt very safe in the hospital and appreciated how dedicated providers were “to keeping me on this side of mortality.”
But it was hard for him to take how severely the hospital stay undermined his independence.
“At home, I could get all around my apartment with the long oxygen tubing.
I could get things for myself and go to the bathroom by myself.
In the hospital, you’re so dependent,” he says.
“No one wants to be dependent.”
Shifting to cope with a pandemic
COVID-19 is changing the face of hospital at home.
Looking back a decade or so ago, Leff says, “This was very lonely work.”
There was just a handful of programs, often offered through the Department of Veterans Affairs or as part of research studies.
Then about two years ago, interest began creeping up.
“Obamacare had taken hold, and thinking about value-based care had grown,” he explains.
“Health systems had already done the easier stuff” and began considering hospital at home.
Since COVID-19 hit, Leff hears about new programs practically every day.
The growth is due partly to pandemic-related easing of payment-related and other regulations by government and private insurers, he notes.
But it’s not just new programs that are changing the hospital-at-home landscape.
About a third of existing programs have expanded during the pandemic even as others temporarily shuttered so providers could help on hospital wards, says DeCherrie.
In her own program, staff jumped in last March to move non-COVID-19 patients out of Mount Sinai and free up much-needed beds.
That represented a significant expansion for her team.
Previously, they’d accepted patients only straight from the emergency department, not those who had been receiving in-patient care.
The program’s numbers soon soared.
“At first, we took only non-COVID patients, but once we were granted enough PPE, we took COVID-19 patients too,” DeCherrie says.
“So many of them had been in the ICU, and they were healing but still needed attention, so we brought them home to finish their last three or four days of care.”

Atrium created its program in March with a similar goal of opening up hospital beds for the hardest-hit COVID-19 patients, notes Stephanie Murphy, DO, medical director of the program.
But she notes that leaders also wanted to protect other patients and staff from infected individuals and, of course, to allow patients to receive care where they are most comfortable: at home.
Atrium’s COVID-19 program has what Murphy calls two “floors”: one for less-sick patients under observation and one for acute care.
At one point, the observation floor had nearly 3,000 patients, she says.
“That floor is primarily driven by our nursing staff,” who are available 24/7, Murphy explains.
“Patients answer questions about their symptoms via an app or phone call.
Nurses can reach out to patients who are showing red flags, and we can then help treat them more aggressively.”
Acute-level patients receive a self-monitoring kit, including a pulse oximeter to measure heart rate and oxygen uptake.
Each day, they get multiple calls to check on their vitals, a virtual doctor’s appointment, and a daily in-home visit from a paramedic that can include EKGs, lab tests, and such advanced treatments as IV medications and respiratory therapies.
Ramona Reeves used the program after COVID-19 slammed her with shortness of breath, fatigue, fever, and a racking cough.
“I was stuck in my room
[quarantining].
After a week, you start to panic a little.
Not seeing a doctor messes with your mind,” says the 56-year-old medical scheduling coordinator.
“It felt good to have someone come in and take my vital signs.”
She particularly appreciated her providers’ kindness and supportiveness.
“I was so grateful that they were willing to come to my house” given that she contracted the virus early in the pandemic, before its contagiousness was better understood.
“They had to go home to their own families, but they didn’t make me feel like I had the plague,” she says.
“Just their friendliness made me feel a whole lot better.”
Will it last?
Proponents of hospital at home now face the question of what the future holds.
Much of the answer lies in another question: How willing are insurers to pay for it?
“We have negotiated contracts with five health insurances under their commercial, Medicare Advantage, and managed Medicaid plans,” says Mount Sinai’s DeCherrie.
“But there is still no payment model from standard Medicare.
They are very interested, though, and I think it’s coming.”
Johns Hopkins’ Leff adds that in recent months, he’s been approached by several major commercial insurers for guidance on possible payment models.
In addition, leaders of a consortium of hospital-at-home programs are working to create quality standards that could shape regulatory and reimbursement policies.
Patients are definitely interested.
According to a national survey of 1,000 adults released in May, 80% of respondents said they were likely to use the service, and of those, 37% were “highly likely” to do so.
Also encouraging is the development of additional portable and remote medical tools, says Levine.
Already, his team uses and is further perfecting a blood-lab device that fits in the palm of a technician’s hand and provides a rapid, on-site result.
“One day, hospitals will be just ERs, ORs, and ICUs.
Everything else should get pushed out into the community.”
Bruce Leff, MD
Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine
Meanwhile, Leff hopes hospitals will increasingly appreciate the advantages of reduced brick-and-mortar investments.
“The average cost [of building a hospital] is about $2 million per bed, so we’re talking about a billion dollars to build a 500-bed hospital.
That’s real money,” he says.
“Then you have to worry about filling those beds.”
For his part, Levine says he’d like to see hospital at home help address the dire shortages of hospitals in rural areas.
He’s working toward that goal, and this month, he’s launching the first rural hospital at home, in Utah, as part of a research project.
But Leff envisions an even more dramatic future for the model nationwide.
“One day, hospitals will be just ERs, ORs, and ICUs,” he predicts.
“Everything else should get pushed out into the community.
That’s what we saw during the peak of the pandemic at several major medical centers,” he says.
“It could be 20 years or even more, but I think that’s where it will go.”
Health psychology Professor Jennifer Hahn-Holbrook and incoming grad student Jessica Marino have a new study suggesting that the breastmilk of mothers who have recovered from COVID-19 contains strong antibodies to the virus.
In the fight against the global pandemic, there is an urgent need to identify factors such as SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in milk that may help confer immunity, particularly for vulnerable newborns, the researchers said.
Because human milk contains high levels of these secretory-type antibodies, breastfeeding by mothers who recover from COVID-19 could pass on immunity to babies, and there’s a chance the purified milk antibodies could be a therapy for adults suffering from COVID-19.
Hahn-Holbrook’s research focuses on breastfeeding and Marino, who graduated from UC Merced with a degree in psychology in 2016, has been the driver of this project.
As a graduate student in the Health Psychology Ph.D. program, Marino concentrates on the development and expression of maternal behavior.
She plans to study how hormones affect maternal behavior and the intergenerational effects that mother-child relationships can have on health.
Her ultimate goal is to find protective maternal factors that might mitigate health risks in vulnerable children.
Marino and Hahn-Holbrook, with the Department of Psychological Sciences, answered a series of questions about their breastmilk-antibody study:
What was the original research question you asked?
Did you already know that breast milk contained SARS antibodies?
When moms get sick, breast milk sometimes contains antibodies to help infants fight off that particular disease.
Antibodies help your immune system recognize and destroy pathogens like COVID-19.
But COVID-19 is a completely new disease, so, before we did this study, no one knew whether breast milk from mothers who recovered from COVID-19 would contain antibodies.
Perhaps more importantly, we also wanted to do this first study of COVID-19-specific antibodies in milk to see exactly the type of COVID-19 antibodies that are present, because some types of antibodies provide more powerful protection than others.
Were you surprised at the results?
We were happy but not surprised to see that all mothers who recovered from COVID-19 had antibodies for COVID-19 in their breast milk.
This is good news because it opens the door to using breast milk from COVID-19-recovered mothers to treat critically ill babies or prevent severe illness in vulnerable infants.
While our small study of 15 moms only gives us a snapshot of what is likely a dynamic immune response, it provides good reason to continue exploring the power of human milk to treat or prevent COVID-19 in infants.
We were also pleased but not surprised to find high levels of a special type of antibody in milk called sIgA, which is especially good at fighting diseases that attack the lung lining such as COVID-19.
One thing that surprised us was that we found immune compounds that responded to COVID-19 even in the milk of mothers in our control group who were never infected with COVID-19.
This suggests that breast milk may have some general immune properties that help babies fight COVID-19, even if mothers have never been infected with the disease.
Infected children are potential “reservoirs” for the evolution of new variants as well as potential spreaders of current variants, explains Lael Yonker.
By studying 110 children aged two weeks to 21 years who tested positive for COVID-19 at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) or urgent care clinics, researchers confirmed earlier findings that infants, children and adolescents are equally capable of carrying high levels of live, replicating SARS-CoV-2 in their respiratory secretions.
The researchers at Harvard-affiliated MGH and colleagues from Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard then showed that these high levels of virus correspond with live, infectious virus, and that levels are highest early in the illness in both symptomatic and asymptomatic children.
They found no correlation between the age of the children and the amount of their viral load.
The researchers published additional data on several features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in children in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.
“There had been the question about whether the high viral load in children correlated with the live virus.
We’ve been able to provide a definitive answer that these high viral loads are infectious,” says Lael Yonker, pediatric pulmonologist at MGH and co-first author with Julie Boucau, senior research scientist at MGH and the Ragon Institute.
Reassuringly, they also found that viral load had no correlation to severity of disease in the kids themselves, but concerns remain for them and those around them: “Children can carry the virus and infect other people,” says Yonker.
Students and teachers have returned to classrooms, but many questions remain about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children.
Most children are asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic when they develop COVID-19, giving the misconception that children are less infectious.
Studying the virologic features of SARS-CoV-2 in children with COVID-19, and how SARS-CoV-2 infection differs between children and adults, is an essential component for establishing effective public health policies, not only to ensure safety within the school but also for controlling the pandemic, says Yonker.
As COVID-19 variants continue to emerge, infected children are potential “reservoirs” for the evolution of new variants as well as potential spreaders of current variants, she says.
“Kids with COVID-19, even if asymptomatic, are infectious and can harbor SARS-CoV-2 variants.
Variants could potentially impact both the severity of the disease and the efficacy of vaccines, as we are seeing with the Delta variant.
When we cultured the live virus, we found a wide variety of genetic variants,” adds Yonker.
“New variants have the potential to be more contagious and also make kids sicker.”
Yonker emphasizes that the group’s findings reinforce the importance of masking for children: “The implications of this study show that masking and other public health measures are needed for everyone — children, adolescents, and adults — to get us out of this pandemic.”
The viral loads of kids in the hospital were no different from those found in hospitalized adults, according to the study.
Evidence cited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that when compared to adults, children “likely have similar viral loads in their nasopharynx, similar secondary infection rates, and can spread the virus to others.”
Increasing awareness of pediatric COVID-19 and implementing broader testing programs for children are two of Yonker’s aspirations.
According to the CDC, the “true incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is not known due to lack of widespread testing and the prioritization of testing for adults and those with severe illness.”
Yonker adds: “To develop effective public health policies, we need data-driven public health guidance.
Kids are an essential component of beating the COVID-19 pandemic, and we must learn more about how they are affected and interact with others.”

It’s scariant season—again.
A new offshoot of Omicron, BA.2.86—nicknamed Pirola—has popped up in Israel, the US, South Africa, and the UK after it was first recorded in Denmark in late July.
Pirola initially set off alarm bells because it was spotted in four countries at the same time—and because, having majorly curtailed our viral surveillance systems, we don’t know how long it’s been making the rounds.
Plus, the sheer number of mutations it has was reason enough to be spooked—BA.2.86 boasts more than 30 new mutations, compared to the most recently dominant variant, XBB.1.5.
“The only other time we’ve seen such a large genetic shift was the initial transition from Delta to Omicron, which led to the most hospitalizations and the most deaths of any surge in the pandemic,” says Dan Barouch, head of the vaccine research division at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.
As a result, scientists across the world are scrambling to figure out whether BA.2.86 is indeed something to worry about.
Early studies suggest that Pirola isn’t much better at evading immunity than previous variants, despite all of its mutations.
The protection offered by vaccines should hold up, and if you’ve been naturally exposed to the XBB variant, you should be better equipped to fight off this new variant.
Why is Pirola not very good at evading immunity, despite having undergone so many mutations?
It’s likely that it evolved from BA.2, an older, more familiar form of Sars-CoV-2 that’s no longer circulating today, meaning that Pirola is less resistant to neutralization than more recent variants, such as XBB.1.5.
But it’s possible that the variant may continue to evolve and change, Barouch warns, so staying vigilant will be key.
Determing whether it will take off and become the dominant form of the virus in circulation will require a “wait-and-see” approach, Barouch adds.
“However, it does not appear to be spreading at the same pace as, say, the original BA.1 or BA.5,” he says, referring to two of the Omicron variants that spread particularly quickly.
Anna Bershteyn, an assistant professor and colead of the Covid modeling team at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, agrees: so far, so reassuring.
“As far as we know, it doesn’t seem likely that this is going to be one of these huge waves of hospitalizations and deaths, the kind that have overwhelmed the health system in prior epidemic waves.”
In the UK, a care home in the east of England was invaded by the variant: 33 residents caught Covid, with 28 definitely infected with BA.2.86—suggesting that it’s pretty easily transmitted.
But only two hospitalizations have been reported, which hints that Pirola doesn’t cause more severe disease than existing variants.
In certain parts of the world, its appearance has sparked action in the form of hastened booster programs.
In the UK, the booster kick-off was rescheduled from October to within the next few weeks.
In the US, the latest round of boosters is expected to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration very soon (although who should get one remains a source of debate).
The findings of a recent preprint suggest that Moderna’s XBB.1.5 booster seems to work well against the BA.2.86 variant.
But while BA.2.86 may not yet be spreading rampantly, a Covid wave is indeed unfurling, with cases once again rising.
In the US, hospitalizations are up, although they’re still nowhere near the sky-high levels they were at this time last year.
Cases are also mushrooming in the UK and in Europe.
For now, BA.2.86’s spread is shaping up to be nothing like the Omicron wave that rocketed across the world at the end of 2021—the last time we saw such a big raft of Covid mutations appear.
As one scientist put it, Pirola may be a “real nothingburger.”
The COVID-19 pandemic has sent shockwaves throughout the global economy.
Some economies have been affected more severely than others.
It started with a few deaths in Wuhan, China, with the earliest reported case on November 17, 2019.
By December 31, 2019, when the Chinese authorities first reported it to the World Health Organization (WHO), it was already a full-fledged outbreak.
From the outbreak in Wuhan, the virus took different times to reach the borders of different countries, depending on various factors such as connectivity and proximity to the Chinese city.
Within different countries, the virus spread through the population at varying speeds depending on a range of factors such as cultural and behavioural responses of the community, population density, average household size, among others.
This pattern has led to substantial variation in the preparedness of countries and their responses to the crisis.
In this article, we trace the timeline of the spread of COVID-19 in the early days
[i] to different countries and their proactiveness in implementing some common social distancing measures.
When tackling a virulent virus like COVID-19, early interventions are crucial to stay ahead of the disease and we restrict our analysis to the first few hundred cases.
We use COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins CSSE repository [ii] and data on a few commonly used government interventions from the Oxford COVID-19 government response tracker [iii].
It is important to note that we use the earliest date for the strictest interventions and not advisories or cautionary notes sent by the governments since advisories can easily be ignored by the citizens.
Japan, South Korea and the United States confirmed their first case of COVID-19 approximately three weeks after the reported outbreak in China.
From then on, disease progression within these countries varied quite a bit.
While it took 42 days to reach 100 confirmed cases in the U.S., Japan reached that number in 31 days and South Korea in 29 days.
Subsequently, the rate of progression increased drastically in South Korea and the U.S., and relatively less rapidly in Japan.
Japan’s early success can partly be attributed to early social distancing measures like closure of schools until April and targeted testing of clusters [iv].
South Korea first cancelled all public events, then imposed an international travel ban even before the 100th case was reported.
South Korea embarked on developing their own test and adopting a policy of stringent testing following by contact tracing [v].
As of March 29, the U.S. has over 140,000 confirmed cases while South Korea has over 9,000 confirmed cases and Japan has over 1,800 confirmed cases.
Singapore and France both reported their first confirmed case 23 and 24 days from the outbreak and both countries reached 100 confirmed cases in 37 and 36 days, respectively.
Singapore promptly instituted an international travel ban around the same time as their first confirmed case, followed by a very strict screening and quarantine measures [vi].
France, in contrast, instituted only screening measures for international travellers a few days later and a ban on public events around the same time that its confirmed cases rose to 100.
Other social distancing measures were instituted much later.
The number of confirmed cases in Singapore rose more slowly than France, with Singapore reporting 844 confirmed cases and France reporting over 40,000 confirmed cases as of March 29.
India reported the first confirmed case 29 days after the outbreak around a month after the report of the outbreak around the same time as Italy, the U.K., Spain and Belgium.
Italy was more proactive than India in instituting international travel controls.
Yet, Italy confirmed 100 cases in another 23 days compared to India’s 45 days.
India started taking social distancing measures like closing workplaces and schools before reaching 100 confirmed cases.
But public gatherings were still occurring in Italy, the most crucial of which turned out to be a football match [vii].
As of March 29, India had over 1,000 confirmed cases while Italy had over 97,000 confirmed cases.
The U.K., Spain, Belgium also confirmed their first cases around the same time as India and Italy but have not been as proactive about policies.
The result of their delay can be seen in the number of their confirmed cases now.
As of March 29, the U.K. had over 19,000 confirmed cases, Spain had over 80,000 confirmed cases and Belgium had over 10000 confirmed cases.
Iran presents a cautionary tale, with its first confirmed case around 50 days since the report of the outbreak.
It took only seven days to reach 100 confirmed cases, the shortest time taken by any country.
A combination of political factors, one of which was the country’s parliamentary election (on February 21), led to Iran delaying the cancellation of public events [viii] .
The social distancing measures turned out to be too late as the virus spread rapidly through the population infecting another 100 people in one day and so on.
As of March 29, Iran has over 38,000 confirmed cases with a death toll of over 2000.
Austria, Netherlands and Switzerland all confirmed their first case 56 days from the outbreak.
All three countries have taken social distancing measures but only after the number of cases rose significantly.
Austria currently has over 8,000 confirmed cases while Switzerland and Netherlands have over 10,000 confirmed cases.
As we look back at the early days of the spread of the pandemic, countries that were proactive in taking strict steps prohibiting social gathering, such as Singapore and South Korea, managed to bring the pandemic under control swiftly.
The lessons learned from these severely affected nations will prove to be particularly useful for African nations where the number of cases of COVID-19 are starting to rise.
These countries should immediately take stringent measures relating to international travel and social distancing.

Everyone should get the new COVID-19 booster, experts say, even if you have gotten previous vaccinations or come down with COVID-19 during the omicron wave in late 2021 and early 2022.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week signed off on a new COVID-19 booster shot aimed at targeting the highly contagious omicron variant of the coronavirus.
The endorsement clears the way for a booster campaign that could help reduce the severity of a fall and winter surge.
The shots “can help restore protection that has waned since previous vaccination and were designed to provide broader protection,” CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a statement.
Almost 68 percent of the U.S. population is considered fully vaccinated with two jabs, while a little more than a third of Americans age 5 and older have gotten at least one booster shot.
“How high that wave is, and how overwhelmed our hospital systems are, are going to be a direct correlation with how many people get their booster…”
Meanwhile, community spread remains high in nearly 85 percent of counties in the country, according to the CDC.
Researchers who spoke with the PBS NewsHour said they were concerned that COVID-19 cases and deaths may rise in the coming months as colder weather forces gatherings back inside.

“How high that wave is, and how overwhelmed our hospital systems are, are going to be a direct correlation with how many people get their booster and how this virus mutates,” said Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist and publisher of the Your Local Epidemiologist newsletter.
“One of those things we can control, and the other one, we can’t.”
In 2020 and 2021, COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death behind heart disease and cancer, according to the National Institutes of Health.
A projection from mid-August concluded that getting boosters into arms early this fall would prevent an estimated 12 to 15 percent of deaths over a nine-month period.
Here’s a look at what we know about the new boosters, when people should seek one out and how it works, based on questions from you.
Do I need to get the new COVID-19 booster shot?
“Everyone should be getting a fall booster,” said Jetelina.
Data from the CDC shows that unvaccinated adults 50 and older have a 14 times greater risk of dying from COVID-19 than those who have received the vaccine and two or more booster shots.
Those in the same age range with only one booster were still three times more at risk.
Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, says those who haven’t gotten boosters are at higher risk for infection and severe disease than those who have.
“I’d really strongly urge people to reconsider that and go get a bivalent booster, especially if they haven’t been boosted at all, because the boosting really, really, really does provide a significant benefit,” Rasmussen said.
Wait, what’s a bivalent vaccine?
How is this new COVID-19 booster different?
The new booster shot is a bivalent vaccine, which means that it will target the original SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, as well as the now more-prevalent omicron subvariant BA.5.
That means the vaccine will help boost an immune response to the original strain and new strains, Rasmussen said
“It should broaden people’s immune response and hopefully should be more protective against the BA.5 and the other omicron family variants that are currently circulating,” she said.

When should I get a new COVID-19 booster?
The CDC recommends waiting at least two months after your last COVID-19 vaccine booster or three months following your last infection.
Rasmussen suggests waiting at least three months after either.
“Based on some data that’s come out, it seems that it should probably be at least about three months after your most recent booster or an infection,” Rasmussen said.
“And some people have potentially said that the maximum benefit would be actually closer to six months post your booster or last infection.”
Jetelina agrees, advocating that people should wait at least three to four months after their last COVID infection or booster before getting the new booster.
She notes that people can get boosted earlier than in three to four months, but waiting until that time will help maximize the protection your immune system can provide.
Can I get my COVID-19 booster and flu shot at the same time?
Yes, because influenza and SARS-CoV-2 are different pathogens and your immune system can recover from both vaccine shots at the same time, according to Rasmussen.
“Your immune system can walk and chew gum at the same time,” she said.
Jetelina recommends that if you’re receiving the COVID-19 booster and the flu vaccine at the same time, you get them in different arms.
READ MORE: What are monkeypox symptoms?
Here’s what you need to know
Can I get my COVID-19 booster and monkeypox vaccine together?
Amid the ongoing outbreak of monkeypox, more than 400,000 doses of the JYNNEOS vaccine — originally produced as to improve preparedness for smallpox bioterrorism attack — have been administered so far in the U.S. as a way to lower people’s risk of contracting the disease.
Because the smallpox vaccine is a different pathogen than influenza and SARS-CoV-2, Rasmussen says getting all three should be OK, but more data is needed to be sure.
“It should, in theory, be fine to give that at the same time as a flu vaccine and a COVID vaccine,” she said.
“But I don’t think we have a lot of data.
So that’s something that hopefully people are starting to collect data on what it’s like to deploy JYNNEOS at population scale, to target monkeypox and what those immune responses are going to look like long term and what kind of protection that confers.”
The CDC recommends waiting at least four weeks between receiving a monkeypox vaccine and a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine booster because of the risk of myocarditis (an inflammation of the heart muscle), especially in young men.
READ MORE: Getting COVID-19 is much riskier for your heart than vaccination
If there’s a new COVID-19 variant that becomes dominant, will this new booster protect me?
It depends on the characteristics of the variant, Jetelina said.
If it’s another omicron subvariant, as BA.4 and BA.5 are, the booster should work well.
If it’s a different variant, public health experts are hopeful that the bivalent booster will still help because it includes components of the original SARS-CoV-2 virus and the omicron variant.
“It won’t be as good, but there will be some sort of protection,” she said.

Here are some of the major policy choices the governor has made since COVID-19 entered our lives.
AP Photo/Eric Gay, File
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's diagnosis with COVID-19 Tuesday — and his maskless political event in Collin County the night before — come as ICU beds in hospitals around the state grow increasingly scarce.
Abbott has made "personal responsibility" the hallmark of his pandemic strategy since removing the statewide mask mandate in March.
"Personal vigilance to follow the safe standards is still needed to contain COVID," he said at the time.
More recently, Abbott announced a ban on local governments and schools from imposing their own mask mandates .
The order drew a lawsuit from a disability rights group and defiance from several counties and school districts.
Personal responsibility and rejecting government restrictions is an appeal to Abbott's political base, according to UT-Austin government professor Eric McDaniel.
He said the AIDS epidemic taught us that politics and public health don't mix.
"The Reagan Administration did not want to talk about safe sex," McDaniel recalled.
"Because their supporters didn't want to talk about that.
And not talking about that actually undercut the message of trying to prevent the spread of AIDS.
"
Here are some of the major policy choices the governor has made since COVID-19 entered our lives:
Early Days Of The Pandemic
Initially, Gov. Abbott deferred to local officials for COVID precaution closures.
Then, on March 19, 2020, he issued an executive order temporarily closing schools, bars, and gyms, along with restricting visits to nursing homes and long-term care facilities.
Additionally, restaurants could no longer welcome dine-in customers, though the Governor's order "allowed and highly encouraged" takeout and drive-thru food sales.
As TPR's Dominic Anthony Walsh reported , "these restrictions were unpopular with a swath of the population.
Their dissatisfaction was most prominently voiced by Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who suggested that he and other elderly Americans were willing to die for the economy .
Spring 2020:
Reopening Begins
In mid-April — about a month after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared a statewide disaster in response to COVID-19 — frustration was growing in Austin.
Outside of the state capitol building, protesters complained about stay-at-home orders.
"I'm sick of being told if I go outside and gather in a group of 10 or more that I'm gonna kill somebody or get killed," one protester told KVUE News .
Soon after, Abbott made the decision to reopen.
"We've shown that we can both continue our efforts to contain the coronavirus, while also adopting safe standards that will allow us to begin the process of reopening business in Texas," he announced on April 17.
After that announcement, Phase 1 of the governor's plan to reopen Texas kicked off, and every two weeks a new phase began.
Reported by TPR's Bonnie Petrie.
For more, check out the full story here .
Summer 2020:
Abbott Issues Statewide Mask Mandate
On July 2, 2020, Gov. Abbott issued an executive order requiring Texans to wear facemasks in most public settings, …something very unpopular with hardline conservatives in his party.
Weeks later, he addressed the order at the Republican Party of Texas' virtual convention.
"I know that many of you do not like the mask requirement.
I don't either," he said in a recorded address .
"It is the last thing that I wanted to do.
Actually, the next to last.
"
As KERA's Bret Jaspers reported at the time , "The effort to shore up support among party activists comes as Abbott is under fire over his response to the coronavirus outbreak."
By July 2020, eight county Republican parties had formally censured the governor .
All Businesses Reopen At 100% Capacity
In March 2021, Abbott lifted the statewide executive orders that limit occupancy for businesses and require Texans to wear masks in public spaces.
The governor said businesses can limit capacity or “implement additional safety protocols” if they wish and that counties can restrict occupancy if COVID-related hospitalization rates in their Trauma Service Area rise above 15% for seven straight days.
Abbott was at Montelongo's in Lubbock when he made the announcement, and explained "It is clear from the recoveries, from the vaccinations, from the reduced hospitalizations and from the safe practices that Texans are using, that state mandates are no longer needed.
"
The changes began on March 10.
"It is now time to open Texas 100%," Abbott said in Lubbock.
"Everybody who wants to work should have that opportunity.
Every business that wants to open should be open.
"
The crowd at the restaurant cheered Abbott's announcement, though he followed by saying it's still up to individuals to be responsible with COVID-19 precautions.
"Removing state mandates does not end personal responsibility or the importance of caring for your family members and caring for your friends and caring for others in the community," the governor said.
Blocking Mask Mandates
And The Fight Against Local Governments And Schools
Abbott issued another executive order in May of 2021 prohibiting cities, counties, school districts, public health authorities and other government entities from requiring people to wear face coverings.
At the time, Travis County Judge Andy Brown criticized Abbott’s order, calling it “irresponsible at best and dangerous at worst.”
“By prohibiting school districts from taking common-sense steps to keep kids safe, the Governor has put our most vulnerable, young children, at risk … By prohibiting local communities from having basic mask requirements in place, he has put at risk our public servants and essential workers, folks who have put the health and safety of themselves and their families on the line throughout the pandemic,” Brown told KUT .
In July 2021, Abbott doubled down on his push to ensure COVID-19 vaccines and mask-wearing remained optional in the state.
He issued an executive order that effectively voided nearly all of his previous COVID-related executive orders and combined some of them into one.
The main takeaway: The state and local governments can't require masks or vaccines.
That prompted local leaders and school districts to push back, making their own plans in defiance of the governor's orders.
This Month
Abbott announced Aug. 9 that Texas will bring in medical personnel from out of state to help treat COVID-19 patients.
The governor also asked hospitals to voluntarily postpone elective medical procedures.
On Aug. 17, 2021, the governor's office announced Abbott tested positive for COVID-19 .
His office said he was not experiencing symptoms and was receiving monoclonal antibody treatment .
Abbott was vaccinated against COVID-19 in December.
His diagnosis came as Texas was seeing its highest COVID-related hospitalizations and the governor was locked in several legal battles over whether schools , cities and counties can require masks.
KERA’s Bret Jaspers, KUT's Marisa Charpentier and Rachel Osier Lindley of The Texas Newsroom contributed to this report.
Many factors have the potential to contribute to the induction and propagation of osteonecrosis of the jaw related to post COVID-19 infection.
The main factor is the virus itself, which causes ACE-2 downregulation and subsequent hyperinflammatory state, with elevated cytokines and immune dysregulation, in addition to microvascular thromboses and the hypercoagulability state [3, 4].
The second factor is the drugs used for the management of the hyperinflammatory syndrome and cytokine storm, which are the corticosteroids and the biological drugs like the Monoclonal Antibody Tocilizumab
[8, 9].
The third factor is the co-infections, which could be either bacterial or fungal secondary infections [10,11,12].
The fourth factor is the associated co-morbidities, especially diabetes, which further impair the local and innate body immunity [13, 14].
All these factors are directly linked to the development of jaw osteonecrosis, either independently or as a result of their interactions.
An arbitrary statement of these factors is presented in Fig. 4.
Fig.
4 Flowchart outlining potential Post-COVID-19 Related osteonecrosis of the Jaw (PC-RONJ) predisposing factors Full size image
This is a report of twelve SARS-CoV-2 infection-survived cases with manifestations of maxillary jaw osteonecrosis, which developed after the infectious course of the disease over various periods.
None of the patients had fungal infection, confirmed by negative preoperative fungal swab, negative histopathological reports, and the treatment consisted of surgical debridement and antibiotics without any antifungal medications.
The mean time until the diagnosis of osteonecrosis was 5.5 ± 2.43 weeks after recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection.
This time frame is in accordance with Boymuradov et al., who reported a minimal elapsed period of 2 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection to develop the symptoms of osteonecrosis, and a maximum symptom-free period of 8 months [15].
All patients in this study received corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19.
Recent studies on COVID-19 recovered patients have shown the increased risk of developing osteonecrosis with the use of glucocorticoids [16, 17].
Daltro et al. (2020) conducted a literature review to assess the relationship between COVID-19 and osteonecrosis, where the findings of eleven studies related COVID-19 to osteonecrosis and the use of corticosteroids; therefore, they concluded that there is sufficient evidence for a corticosteroid-associated risk of avascular necrosis in patients with COVID-19
[18].
The unjustified utilization of corticosteroids as a component of the COVID-19 treatment protocol is a common practice without scientific support, especially in mild to moderate cases.
Moreover, Wang et al. conducted a meta-analysis to demonstrate the proportion and effect of corticosteroid therapy in patients with COVID-19 infection, where they deduced that a delayed viral clearance was a hallmark in patients with COVID-19 who received corticosteroid therapy with no clearly improved survival rate [19].
Therefore, the use of corticosteroids in the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection must be balanced between its advantage and post-infection drawbacks and complications.
As a result, the use of corticosteroids should be restricted to severe cases and only during acute respiratory symptoms.
All of the included patients have additional comorbidities; where all of them were diabetic.
Several reports have linked the association between COVID-19 in patients with diabetes with the occurrence of necrosis of the jaws and other bones [15, 18, 20, 21].
Microvascular angiopathy is a well stated complication of diabetes, which impairs bone nutrition through loss of full function of the nutrient vessels in bone.
Increased blood sugar level has a direct effect on white blood cells chemotaxis and phagocytosis, which subsequently improves viral binding affinity and reduce virus clearance
[18, 20].
Shin et al. (2020) reported that physicians should manage diabetes with proactive strategies to minimize the risk of medical complications in SARS-CoV-2 affected patients [20].
Interestingly, all of the reported cases which considered to have a potential relationship between COVID-19 and osteonecrosis of the jaw were exclusively found in the maxilla.
This may be attributed to the close proximity to the nasal mucosa and maxillary sinus.
Furthermore, the high expression of ACE-2 receptors in the nasal and oral mucosa epithelial cells may act as a vital risk factor for the occurrence of decreased blood supply [5, 6].
It is speculated that a sinusitis-induced osteomyelitis is the commencement point for this aggressive condition as SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory tract infection.
Bagaria (2021), in an attempt to explain those peculiar orthopedic post-COVID manifestations, postulated that aggressive SARS-CoV-2 infection depletes immune defense mechanism, which leaves the patient vulnerable to infection episodes.
This phenomenon is called ‘Consumption Immuno-compromisation’.
In his report, Bagaria (2021) reported the occurrence of two cases of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the long bone and two cases of acute primary septic joint, along with a high rate of postoperative infection [22].
All of the bony manifestations that are encountered in this study developed spontaneously, without any provoking events.
This spontaneous incidence of bone necrosis is a cause of concern and should be a point of additional analysis.
Several authors have reported the spontaneous occurrence of jawbone necrosis without any precipitating events or predisposing factors [23, 24].
Khominsky and Lim (2018) conducted a systematic review of the spontaneous occurrence of Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (MRONJ), where they concluded that the “spontaneous” nomenclature is a misnomer as most of the literature-reported cases are the sequelae of low-grade trauma to thin susceptible mucosa covering anatomical regions at-risk areas [23].
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first series of reported cases with maxillary osteonecrosis following SARS-CoV-2 infection.
This article is limited by its observational pilot nature and limited sample size.
The exact pathogenesis of jaw necrosis, and whether the virus contributing effect alone can initiate pathological vascular necrosis without the ramifying effect of steroid therapy or patients comorbidity are topics for future research.
Furthermore; the decrease in blood supply to the affected hard and soft tissues of the maxilla could not be evaluated in this study.
A prophylactic approach should be presented for the early detection of bone osteonecrosis by the assessment of the vasculature of the maxillary hard and soft tissues in suspected patients.
Finally, several recurring risk factors must be built before considering a patient to have PC-RONJ.
A recent SARS-CoV-2 infection with concurrent cumulative corticosteroid prescription, systematic co-morbid conditions, no history of current or previous radiotherapy, antiresorptive, or antiangiogenic agents intake all of which are considered as precipitating factors for the occurrence of un-provoked jawbone osteonecrosis.
A practical guidelines is called for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of jaw osteonecrosis in patients with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection.
With the increasing rate of COVID-19, the general dentists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons must be best prepared and positioned for the early identification and prevention of PC-RONJ to avoid permeant deformity.
There is a need for communication between oral and maxillofacial surgeons and physicians to reduce the severity and the vast degree of avoidable morbidity that may occur as a consequence of an unjustified corticosteroid prescription, where they can modify the COVID-19 treatment protocol.
A specialized follow-up plan for the early detection of PC-RONJ should be proposed for patients at risk of developing osteonecrosis, as the spontaneous nature of this condition occurs with silent impact.
Today, Walmart is proud to release our One-Year Vaccine report that outlines our all-hands-on-deck approach to fighting the pandemic and keeping our communities safe and healthy.
Over the past year, our approach has focused on meeting people where they are and proving that all health care is local.
With 90% of the population located within 10 miles of a Walmart, and 150 million customers passing through our doors each week, Walmart is in a unique position to provide quality, affordable health and wellness services to all Americans where they already live and shop.
So, when the COVID-19 pandemic called for us to rise to a new challenge, we were already in our local communities, had relationships with thousands of customers and were able to be a trusted voice in the community and meet our customers and patients where they live and work throughout the pandemic.
Over the past year, Walmart has administered tens of millions of vaccines across the country, with 80% being delivered in medically underserved communities as classified by the HRSA.
Our first patient vaccination was administered on December 21, 2020, and within eight weeks, more than 1,000 Walmart and Sam’s Club pharmacies began administering COVID-19 vaccines in 22 states through the U.S. Federal Retail Pharmacy Program.
Our efforts have since grown to encompass 51 states and territories and more than 5,100 retail locations in the U.S., making access as easy as possible for those who want to get vaccinated.
It sounds too good to be true.
But a compelling new study and computer model provide fresh evidence for a simple solution to help us emerge from this nightmarish lockdown.
The formula?
Always social distance in public and, most importantly, wear a mask.
If you’re wondering whether to wear or not to wear, consider this.
The day before yesterday, 21 people died of COVID-19 in Japan.
In the United States, 2,129 died.
Comparing overall death rates for the two countries offers an even starker point of comparison with total U.S. deaths now at a staggering 76,032 and Japan’s fatalities at 577.
Japan’s population is about 38% of the U.S., but even adjusting for population, the Japanese death rate is a mere 2% of America’s.
This comes despite Japan having no lockdown, still-active subways, and many businesses that have remained open—reportedly including karaoke bars, although Japanese citizens and industries are practicing social distancing where they can.
Nor have the Japanese broadly embraced contact tracing, a practice by which health authorities identify someone who has been infected and then attempt to identify everyone that person might have interacted with—and potentially infected.
So how does Japan do it?
“One reason is that nearly everyone there is wearing a mask,” said De Kai, an American computer scientist with joint appointments at UC Berkeley’s International Computer Science Institute and at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
He is also the chief architect of an in-depth study, set to be released in the coming days, that suggests that every one of us should be wearing a mask—whether surgical or homemade, scarf or bandana—like they do in Japan and other countries, mostly in East Asia.
This formula applies to President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence (occasional mask refuseniks) as well as every other official who routinely interacts with people in public settings.
Among the findings of their research paper, which the team plans to submit to a major journal: If 80% of a closed population were to don a mask, COVID-19 infection rates would statistically drop to approximately one twelfth the number of infections—compared to a live-virus population in which no one wore masks.
The mask debate, of course, has been raging for weeks in the States and globally.
Pro-maskers assert that the widespread use of face coverings can diminish the spread of COVID-19.
Some anti-maskers, including various politicians and public health officials, have insisted that there is no proof of the efficacy of face guards.
According to some activists, a blanket mask mandate places a limit on individual liberty and even one’s right to free speech.
(Pro-mask advocates are fighting back with #masks4all and #wearafuckingmask Twitter campaigns).
Representatives of the World Health Organization have also been sounding rather anti-mask, fretting that many people won’t wear masks properly, thereby risking infection, or that masks will give people a false sense of security and encourage risky behavior, such as partying up close and personal—none of which seems to have played out, as far as we know, in Japan or Hong Kong or other mask-wearing places.
Adding to the brouhaha has been the shortage of medical masks for doctors, nurses, bus drivers, and the guy who delivers burritos to your door.
The muddle over masks is what drove Berkeley’s De Kai to drop everything two months ago and help convene an ad hoc team of scientists and academics: a physician from London, a bioinformaticist from Cambridge, an economist from Paris, and a sociologist and population-dynamics expert from Finland.
“I felt like this was pretty urgent,” said De Kai, who was born in St. Louis, and is the son of immigrants from China.
“I saw the country where I grew up, where my family lives [now mostly in the Bay Area], about to face this pandemic without knowing much about something as simple as wearing a mask to protect themselves and others.”
In part, this comes from a cultural difference between East Asia, where masks have been routinely worn for decades to fend off pollution and germs, and other parts of the world.
This includes the U.S., where people are unaccustomed to wearing masks, and, in the past, have sometimes been insensitive, even stigmatizing East Asians, many of whom had chosen to wear them in public prior to the pandemic, and had continued the practice in the aftermath of the SARS and MERS outbreaks.
(In part, this habit was meant to show other people that they were concerned about transmitting the disease—something we in the West would do well to emulate.)

Nita is a Santa Monica resident who received an unsettling phone call last week – the caller said that someone diagnosed with COVID-19 had identified her as someone the person had close contact with before receiving the positive test result.
Nita knew about contact tracing, but was suspicious of the call immediately, because as an older person with an underlying health condition, she was taking precautions against the novel coronavirus and had not had close contact with anyone for months.
She became even more skeptical of the call when she was asked for her Social Security number.
Nita promptly hung up.
She was smart to end the call.
Although the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is doing contact tracing to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus, they will never ask you for Social Security numbers, financial information, payment, or anything about your immigration status.
According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), contact tracing is used by health departments to prevent the spread of infectious disease, and involves identifying people who have an infectious disease (cases) and the people who may have been exposed (contacts) and working with them to interrupt disease transmission.
For COVID-19, this includes asking cases to isolate and contacts to quarantine at home voluntarily.
Legitimate contact tracers will reach out to individuals who test positive for COVID-19, and their recent contacts.
They will ask for your name and date of birth, and information about anyone with whom you have been in close contact.
If you receive a call, text, or email from someone who identifies themselves as a contact tracer, keep these points in mind:
Never give callers your Social Security number, bank-account number, immigration status, or other similar personal financial information, or make any kind of payment to anyone representing themselves as a contact tracer.
immigration status, or other similar personal financial information, or make any kind of payment to anyone representing themselves as a contact tracer.
Beware of suspicious links and attachments in emails or texts.
Remember that scammers can spoof phone numbers and email addresses to make it look like they are legitimate.
Do not click on links in ads or social media posts about contact tracing.
DO respond to legitimate contact tracers to help stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.
If you hear from someone who identifies themselves as a contact tracer, and you are not sure it’s legitimate, you can contact the Los Angeles County Public Health Department at (833) 540-0473 to check the caller’s credentials.
Contact tracing is a key factor in fighting the novel coronavirus, so it’s important to talk with public health workers and answer their questions.
The information you provide is confidential and will only be used for health purposes.
With vigilance you can avoid being scammed.

SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) — Two former top officials at a Massachusetts veterans home where nearly 80 residents died in one of the country’s deadliest COVID-19 outbreaks in a long-term care facility appeared in court Tuesday in an effort to have their criminal charges dismissed.
Lawyers for former Holyoke Soldiers’ Home Superintendent Bennett Walsh and former Medical Director Dr. David Clinton argued on a number of motions to dismiss the case in Hampden Superior Court in Springfield.
They maintained the state had not met its burden of proof for charging their clients with 10 counts each, including abuse, neglect, or mistreatment of an elderly or disabled person.
“We don’t think anyone here should be blamed criminally for anything,” Michael Jennings, a lawyer for Walsh, argued.
“The blame here belongs to the virus, not with anyone who worked in that nursing home.”
RELATED
Prosecutors argued that the decision by Walsh, Clinton and other facility leaders to cram residents who were positive for the coronavirus into the same unit as those with no symptoms was negligent.
The judge didn’t immediately make a ruling, and another court date was set for the end of October.
Walsh and Clinton have complained they’re being scapegoated by state officials.
One of Walsh’s lawyers also suggested Tuesday that his client’s effort to alert state officials relatively early in the crisis helped save lives by allowing the state to mobilize the National Guard.
Former superintendent of the Soldiers' Home in Holyoke, Bennett Walsh, right, listens to testimony while sitting next to his attorney, William Bennett, during a hearing in Hampden Superior Court, Tuesday, Aug. 24, 2021, in Springfield, Mass.
The hearing was held to consider a motion to dismiss criminal charges against Walsh and former medical director, Dr. David Clinton, in the criminal case brought against them by Attorney General Maura Healey due to a deadly COVID-19 outbreak in the facility.

But an independent report commissioned by the state concluded that “utterly baffling” decisions made by facility administrators allowed the virus to spread unchecked last March as the pandemic took hold in the U.S.
At least 76 veterans died from the virus over 11 weeks, and many more residents and staff were sickened.
Earlier this month, veterans home workers filed a class-action suit against several members of the facility’s former leadership team, including Walsh and Clinton.
The workers allege they were forced to care for sick and dying veterans, sometimes after testing positive themselves, in “inhumane conditions.”
The workers argued in the lawsuit filed in federal court that Holyoke Soldiers’ Home administrators initially ignored guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for containing the virus and lied to state officials about measures they were taking to protect residents and staff once the first veteran tested positive in March 2020.
Walsh, who resigned in October, declined to comment.
Clinton strongly denied the allegations.
Army Veteran Kolan Glass is not a doctor or a nurse.
Still, in the battle against COVID-19, he is one of the most critical employees at North Las Vegas VAMC.
Glass is the primary housekeeper in the emergency department.
After a Veteran has been released, Glass ensures the room is sanitized and prepared for the next patient.
“I clean every room as I would want it if I was the next patient to be staying in it,” says Glass.
“I sanitize each room with my full attention.”
Using technology to ensure safety
Glass and his fellow housekeepers employ the latest technology to prevent infection.
This includes a remote-controlled system that uses ultraviolet light to purify equipment, room surfaces and objects.
“Probably about 90 percent of us [housekeepers] are Vets,” he says.
“That means we talk and we don’t panic.
Sure, we’re dealing with a pandemic, but we still have to get the job done and keep everybody safe.”
Glass experienced first-hand how a viral outbreak can test the emergency department.
In March, Glass came in contact with a COVID-19-positive patient.
He and other employees were placed on a 14-day quarantine.
“I didn’t get nervous,” Glass says.
“I understood it was a precautionary measure, but I was ready to get back to work.”
Glass’s supervisor recognizes his dedication and leadership.
“Even after he had to self-isolate from his family, and with the stress of waiting for testing results, he immediately picked up right where he left off,” says Jesse Diaz.
Diaz is chief of environmental management safety (EMS) at North Las Vegas VAMC.
“He’s been very vocal in educating the staff and his housekeeping peers in his area.
He wants to develop a partnership with the clinical staff and EMS to help reduce the chances of COVID-19 infecting or impacting others.”

Parenting and life at home have been impacted in small ways.
I can clean up vomit or a not-so-pleasant bathroom situation without hesitation.
It does give me pause on occasion when someone says “What’s that smell?” — an anxious reminder of the flowers, perhaps, but also because I don’t want to be that person unaware of what’s going on around them.
This happened when I hopped in my car to drive my kids to school this week and my 8-year-old asked, “Mom, why does your car smell like Indian food?”
I was relieved because Indian food is one of our favorites but still, I couldn’t smell anything.
And also, I can assure you I wasn’t eating that in my car.
The other thing Dr. Neubauer opened my eyes to was just how important our sense of smell is.
It’s nostalgia.
Most moments of happiness and memories can be tied to a smell.
And therefore, the sense of smell plays a larger role in our mental health than we might think.
He encouraged me early on to find foods I currently enjoy the taste of because he said depression among COVID long-haulers is a valid concern.
He put me on a program to smell six different oils twice a day for 20 seconds each.
Rose, eucalyptus, lemon, clove bud, sweet orange and peppermint.
My directive was to “sniff these while in a quiet place and just think of each scent.
Think about how it ‘should’ smell.”
The activity certainly hasn’t hurt, but two years later, the eucalyptus scent I once loved still isn’t pleasant at all.

My ENT also recommended I try acupuncture.
I’ve been seeing my acupuncturist, Iris Netzer-Greenfield at NOA Health and Acupuncture, for almost a year now.
The first time I saw her, after she put in the needles and left the room for me to relax a bit, the hot tears came out of nowhere.
If you’ve never done acupuncture, you may not know you aren’t supposed to move once the needles are inserted, so that was a quandary.
The tears were streaming down the side of my face and I desperately needed to blow my nose.
It left me thinking this wave of emotion feels so strong it must happen to everyone else who gets acupuncture.
In that moment, I chalked it up to a literal release of tension, sadness, pressure of expectations and overall gratitude for the time I had had with my family during this horrific pandemic.
Iris is magical.
She didn’t say a word about my face upon her return, but she laid out a plan.
She is hopeful that by working together once a week, I’ll get at least 20% of my smell and taste back.
The thinking behind this eastern medicine practice is by pinpointing certain pathways, it will make everything flow better.
In other words, jump-starting my system and getting the “train back on the track” toward the destination of healing.
She is focusing on the pathway that is connected to my lung because, in eastern medicine, that is the organ linked to the nose.
I can report I do have twinges of scents returning.
I can taste and smell mint in a recognizable way.
A week ago, I thought someone was burning the pumpkin candle in our kitchen when I was out of the room.
When I returned to the kitchen, I saw that I was right and that made me smile.
Candles on a birthday cake, the fresh cut of a football field, my kids’ hair after a bubble bath.
Even my husband’s favorite cologne.
I’m hopeful the ability to smell these things will come back.
In the meantime, acupuncture, lots of nose therapy and answering the question “what’s that smell?” with a bit of humor rather than horror is all right with me.
— (December 3, 2020) RESEARCH UPDATE: After a more comprehensive review of the study, additional data shows the ICAM protocol is not more effective than other protocols as a method of treatment for COVID-19.
We remain committed to the current scientific literature as a foundation of our treatment plan for COVID-19 and being a trusted resource for our community.
Ocala, FL - For months, researchers around the world have worked to find fast and effective ways to treat and care for patients who have been hospitalized for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).
AdventHealth Ocala announced a new groundbreaking clinical trial for a drug therapy developed by the hospital’s Director of Pharmacy and a team of physicians.
The drug combination protocol, known as ICAM, uses readily available medications such as vitamins to boost the immune system, steroids to control inflammation, blood thinners to prevent blood clots and antibiotics to help fight infection.
“For 76 days our patients had zero transfers to the intensive care unit, zero mechanical ventilator placement and zero death with ICAM and ICAM-similar regimens.
I was absolutely pleased to see our patients getting better faster and we were able to provide the guidance needed to save lives,” said Dr. Carlette Norwood-Williams, Director of Pharmacy, AdventHealth Ocala.
“Our research shows the right medication can influence improvements in a COVID-19 patient's inflammatory marker response, contributing to survival of the virus, regardless of age or comorbidity if they can start the therapy as soon as they are diagnosed.”
In this pioneering research, AdventHealth Ocala has seen an unprecedented 96.4% success rate in patients who received only the ICAM protocol immediately after they were admitted.
Additionally, the hospital has partnered with the Marion County Health Department and Heart of Florida Health Centers to provide the ICAM protocol as an outpatient treatment for 100 adults who test positive at those locations and consent to using the treatment.
“I am hopeful that what we’ve done can become a powerful ally in the hands of health care providers to combat this virus, and I am excited to see the expertise of our team of dedicated clinicians and researchers at AdventHealth Ocala be part of something that can help our community and beyond,” said Joe Johnson, President and CEO of AdventHealth Ocala.
The ICAM protocol provides researchers and health care professionals with access to an additional tool to provide treatment to fight COVID-19.
The goal is to replicate the work of the clinical team at AdventHealth Ocala and potentially lower mortality rates in COVID-19 patients around the world.
“We’ve seen firsthand the impact this virus has on the people we care for each day,” said Dr. Ken Barrick, ER Medical Director, AdventHealth Ocala.
“Grandparents haven’t held their grandchildren in months, patients too afraid to come to the ER are suffering and missing much needed care, and parents missed out on seeing their children walk across a stage for graduation.
The impact of this disease goes without measure.
People are afraid, and with good reason, for there has truly been no clear treatment protocol to prevent the progression of the disease, until now.”

“What I don’t understand is why there isn’t more of a sense of urgency about funding research into long COVID, when it is costing society so much,” says Ellen Bark, co-founder of Stichting Long COVID, the Dutch long COVID foundation.
“So far, much of the focus has been on the epidemiology, logging of symptoms, sending out of questionnaires, and the organization of health care,” says her fellow co-founder, Annelies Bos, who has herself been living with long COVID for the past 3 years.
“There have been very few studies looking at the biomedical part of this disease.”
The long COVID foundation seeks to fill this gap by dedicating itself exclusively to fundraising for biomedical research, or research that examines the biological and physical reasons for the condition, including reasons for autoimmunity (where the body’s immune system attacks its own tissues).
Annelies describes how this complements the work of other long COVID organizations in the Netherlands that concentrate more on supporting patients with information, care and rehabilitation, organizing peer contacts or political lobbying, for instance.
“It works because we are all aiming for the same goals, and we are all sending the same message that we need to understand the causes of long COVID so that we can develop treatments.
And to do that, we need money.”
A clear focus
Both Ellen and Annelies come with experience very relevant to developing the foundation: Ellen has expertise in fundraising for start-up businesses and is used to managing complex multiparty innovation projects, while Annelies is a doctor with a large network of contacts in the medical and scientific world and an active member of the Dutch community of long COVID patients.
Together, they are raising money from private sources, both through crowdfunding and through targeted fundraising from high-net-worth individuals, family-run businesses and non-profit organizations.
With studies showing that 10–20% of people who develop COVID-19 go on to experience a variety of mid- and long-term effects after they recover from their initial illness, the foundation is driven by patients’ need for urgent answers.
Therefore, the long COVID foundation has 4 clear values that shape its mission: speed, solution orientation, collaboration, and focus.
Speed and solution orientation
The long COVID foundation has created a team of 8 dedicated researchers who scan and compile the latest research into the condition, so that funding can be directed towards the research they’ve assessed as having the greatest potential.
“Scientists can approach us with proposals for research projects that require between US$ 15 000 and US$ 100 000 of funding, and within 2 weeks we can let them know whether or not it’s in our scope, or whether we need to know more before funding it.”
They currently have a patient sounding board, composed of doctors who themselves have long COVID, which means that any funding decisions can be fairly assessed by people with an understanding of both the condition and the science behind it.
They are now expanding the board to include non-medical participants.
Collaboration
Another part of their work is stimulating new research, as Ellen explains.
“We don’t just raise money.
We also go directly to scientists to see how we can develop concrete research plans or pilot projects to fund.
Since there is so little knowledge, we need to stimulate a lot of good ideas that can generate pilot projects that could give direction to bigger research programmes.
Then we envisage a top-down, global research set-up, which brings together different disciplines from different medical fields.”
To this end, the foundation aims to team up with scientists leading flagship projects and to encourage collaborative work that brings results and stimulates more research.
“Our goal is to set up a national long COVID research consortium with the collaborating university medical hospitals in the Netherlands, so that together we can build up a national patient cohort and biobank.”
Late last year the long COVID foundation funded its first piece of targeted long COVID research into autoimmunity.
The proposal for this research was generated by a think tank composed of 400 undergraduate biomedical science and medicine students from Utrecht University, under the guidance of researchers from the immunology departments of the Utrecht and Amsterdam university medical centers.
As part of the research, students were first given the opportunity to talk to people experiencing long COVID symptoms to understand the impact of the condition.
They then looked at existing research on autoimmunity and investigated how autoantibodies contribute to the development of long COVID symptoms, identifying which ones were involved.
Next, they were challenged to see if existing pharmaceutical drugs could be used in the treatment of long COVID and to come up with out-of-the-box proposals that could further improve understanding of autoimmunity.
Within 3 weeks, the student research hub generated 12 high-quality research proposals for consideration.
Niels Eijkelkamp, principal investigator in the division of laboratories, pharmacy and biomedical genetics at University Medical Center Utrecht, comments, “A professional researcher who has focused on an issue for some time may eventually develop blinders.
These talented students from different disciplines are not burdened with that and can look at the topic with an open mind.”
Although Ellen and Annelies dream of solving long COVID, they believe that even small discoveries that pinpoint the physical causes of the condition would help patients by increasing recognition and bringing hope that there might one day be successful treatments.
“The hardest thing for most patients at the moment is the question of how long it will go on,” says Ellen.
“They just don’t know.
If we can address that aspect, it would be helpful.
If we can find solutions, we can basically give them their lives back.”
Across the WHO European Region at least 17 million people were believed to have experienced post COVID-19 condition (long COVID) in the first 2 years of the pandemic alone.
WHO/Europe is working with Long COVID Europe, a network of long COVID patient associations run by current and former long COVID patients, to ensure that the condition is taken seriously by governments and health authorities through greater recognition and knowledge sharing, research and reporting, and rehabilitation.
The VAP-SIRS model of the impact of COVID-19 VPs
The proposed VAP-SIRS model extends the classical SIRS model44 (red arrows in Fig. 1a) with additional states and parameters that describe the dynamics of vaccination rollout in a population (green arrows in Fig. 1a).
To this end, we consider the following subpopulations: (i) initially susceptible S N , who, if successfully vaccinated, populate the immune group V, with rate aυ, where υ is the vaccination rate and a is the vaccination effectiveness, (ii) susceptible who were vaccinated but did not gain immunity (S 1 ), (iii) vaccinated, whose immunity waned with rate ω and who became susceptible again (S 2 ), (iv) susceptible, who are not and will never get vaccinated (S D ).
The S D compartment contains people who for health reasons cannot receive current types of vaccines, as well as individuals who do not get vaccinated because of hesitancy, beliefs or other individual reasons.
The fraction of the population that will never be vaccinated is denoted by d. Additionally, revaccination of S 2 populates V with rate aυ r .
All recovered, unless in the recovered compartment R D , are also subject to vaccination.
Before the recovered in the R V lose immunity, they might be revaccinated, and, thus, populate the V group with rate υ r (similarly, R N are vaccinated with rate υ).
In this case, vaccination effectiveness is fixed to 1, which is substantiated on the basis of the fact that vaccination combined with a previous infection should confer a much stronger protection than only vaccination of a susceptible individual.
Across the manuscript, we assume the revaccination and vaccination rates are equal, υ r = υ.
Additional sub-compartments are used to model hospitalizations (see the Supplementary Note 1).
The presented model analysis is performed for carefully selected parameter setups.
We consider two different vaccination rates a, 0.004 and 0.008 doses per person daily, chosen on the basis of the current rates observed in Europe51,52.
As vaccine effectivenesses for the Delta variant, we consider 0.6 and 0.79, which were reported as the effectivenesses of the most widely used vaccines: Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca) and Comirnaty (BioNTech/Pfizer) respectively for this variant20.
For the Alpha variant, the effectivenesses of the same vaccines for that variant are considered instead, namely 0.79 (Vaxzevria) and 0.92 (Cominarty)20.
We consider realistic fractions d of never-vaccinated equal to 0.12 (optimistic), and 0.3 (pessimistic), reported for the United Kingdom and France, respectively [https://ourworldindata.org/, as of June 15th, 2021].
Furthermore, two post-vaccination immunity waning rates ω are considered corresponding to optimistic (500 days; ω = 1/500) and pessimistic (200 days; ω = 1/200) average duration of immunity against infection, reflecting emerging data on large individual variation of immunity waning and other key factors influencing this process15,18,24,25,26.
There remains uncertainty regarding the waning time for natural immunity, and whether it varies between the different SARS-CoV-2 variants, but early evidence indicates it lasts at least 180 days15,53,54.
Hence, we consider an optimistic scenario of natural immunity lasting on average similarly long as the optimistic immunity gained via vaccination: 500 days (corresponding to natural immunity waning rate κ = 0.002).
Based on the current studies, we fix the generation time to 6 days (γ = 1/6)10,55.
We assume that VP holders are all those who completed at least one complete vaccination cycle, i.e., one dose or two doses depending on the vaccine used (Fig. 1), which is also the basis on which the EU DCC is issued.
The restriction level (ranging from 0 to 1) is introduced as a modulator of the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number.
Here, we consider that without any restrictions, the basic reproduction number for the B.1.617.2 variant (Delta) is equal to 6 (an optimistic estimate based on refs.
56,57), while for the B.1.1.7 variant (Alpha) an optimistic estimate is equal to 410,55.
Two levels of restrictions are considered: restrictions f v for contacts among VP holders, as well as restrictions f for contacts of the VP holders with the rest of the population and for contacts within the rest of the population.
The impact of VPs is studied assuming that f v <
f: a VP holder has more freedom of contact with other VP holders, or is generally subject to fewer restrictions on the VP holders than the rest of the population.
Importantly, in general f and f v should be interpreted as the net effect of all combined factors that reduce the reproduction number of the virus within the respective groups: all applied non-pharmaceutical interventions, including testing and isolation, together with the resulting changes in behavior.
The situation where no VPs are implemented, hence the vaccinated have the same restrictions as the rest of the population, and there are no changes of behavior due to vaccination, is modeled by fixing f v = f.
Finally, to analyze the impact of social behavior, we consider two types of mixing between subpopulations: proportional (typical for SIR models) and preferential, where the VP holders prefer contacts with other VP holders.
See Methods for a detailed model description.
VAP-SIRS predicts a possible infection resurgence despite vaccinations
VAP-SIRS predicts unfavorable epidemic dynamics for a wide range of parameters, both for the Delta and the Alpha variants.
As an example consider the Delta variant, and vaccine effectiveness a = 0.79 (the effectiveness of the Comirnaty vaccine against the Delta variant), (re-)vaccination rates υ = υ r = 0.004, low never-vaccinated fraction d = 0.12 (reported for the United Kingdom), low immunity waning rate ω = 0.002, low natural immunity rate loss κ = 0.002, and proportional mixing.
This set of parameters corresponds to a seemingly safe setup, which we will call the reference setup.
The impact of various parameter changes with respect to this reference will be considered below.
For such a setup, consider medium-high restrictions level f = 0.77 for contacts of the VP holders with the rest of the population and within the rest of the population, along with a restrictions reduction for the VP holders compared to the rest of the population by around 30%, resulting in medium restrictions f v = 0.55 for VP holders.
For these parameters, the model predicts a small wave of infections shortly after the vaccination program starts, followed by a large wave later (color curves Fig. 1b).
This behavior is explained by the population structure (Muller plot, Fig. 1b) and can only happen due to the different levels of restrictions for the VP holders and the rest of the population.
In this scenario, the first wave is driven by the unvaccinated susceptibles (S N ) and suppressed by ongoing vaccination, as expected.
Interestingly, the second, larger wave is driven by the S V group.
The S V group is composed of the number of individuals for whom the vaccine was ineffective (S 1 ) and those vaccinated who lose their immunity and are not yet revaccinated (S 2 ).
Stability analysis identifies potential scenarios for the COVID-19 epidemic depending on the restrictions imposed on VP holders and the rest of the population
To assess the epidemic evolution in different scenarios, we analyse stability by linearizing the model equations with I = R = 0 and introduce the instantaneous reproduction number \({{{{{{{{\mathcal{R}}}}}}}}}^{* }\) (see Methods).
\({{{{{{{{\mathcal{R}}}}}}}}}^{* }(t)\) is the reproduction number that would be observed at time t, given the restrictions f = (f, f v ) and the composition of the population (the population fractions of the groups: susceptible with VPs S V , susceptible without VPs S, and the immune group V), where the number of infected is very small.
For \({{{{{{{{\mathcal{R}}}}}}}}}^{* }(t) \, > \, 1\), switching to f at time t results in an overcritical epidemic evolution, with an initially exponential growth of infections; for \({{{{{{{{\mathcal{R}}}}}}}}}^{* }(t) \, < \, 1\), switching to f at time t results in a subcritical epidemic evolution, where the number of active cases decreases to zero.
The \({{{{{{{{\mathcal{R}}}}}}}}}^{* }\) is more informative of epidemic thresholds than the standard effective reproduction number, as it does not depend on the actual number of infected and recovered.
Assuming the reference setup for the Delta variant, we consider five choices of restriction combinations (prototypical for five regions of the parameter space, see Fig. 2), leading to different time profiles of \({{{{{{{{\mathcal{R}}}}}}}}}^{* }\)
(Fig. 1c).
As control setups, we introduce two settings that represent policies in a given population without the implementation of the VPs, one with a common high restriction level f = f v = 0.92, which keeps the epidemic subcritical (scenario denoted -, green dot-dashed line in Fig. 1c), and one with a common medium-high restriction level f = f v = 0.77, which results in a time evolution of \({{{{{{{{\mathcal{R}}}}}}}}}^{* }\) from overcritical to subcritical (denoted +-, yellow dot-dashed line in Fig. 1c).
In such settings, in case VPs are introduced, VP holders can gain low (<20%), medium (20-50%) or high (> 50%) restriction reduction with respect to the restrictions for the rest of the population.
Granting high restriction reductions to VP holders, both with mid-high and with high restrictions enforced for the rest of the population, eventually leads to an overcritical epidemic (red and pink curve in Fig.
1c: the red curve shows a persistent overcritical epidemic, a scenario denoted +, while the pink curve shows an epidemic that is initially subcritical and then becomes overcritical, a scenario denoted -+).
Medium restriction reductions for VP holders, along with high restrictions for the rest of the population, yield a subcritical epidemic evolution (another example of scenario -, blue curve in Fig. 1c).
When mid-high restrictions are enforced for the rest of the population, a medium restriction reduction for VP holders leads to an epidemic that is initially overcritical, then becomes subcritical and after a few months switches to overcritical again, starting a new wave of infections (orange curve in Fig.
1c; denoted +-+, this is also the scenario shown in the simulation in Fig 1b).
Finally, always with mid-high restrictions enforced for the rest of the population, a low restriction reduction for VP holders leads to an epidemic that is initially overcritical and then switches to subcritical (another example of scenario +-, cyan curve in Fig 1c).
In each scenario we computed the time evolution of the instantaneous doubling time D, capturing how fast the infections grow.
For a given f, D(t) is the doubling time that would be observed for the growth of a small initial number of infections at time t, with enforced restrictions f.
Very short doubling times, below 30 days, can be observed in three scenarios that are (eventually) overcritical: see the red, orange and pink curves in the Supplementary Fig.
S1.
Flexible measures are required to avoid epidemic resurgence depending on parameter setups
The relevant f − f v parameter space, where f v ≤ f, can be divided into five regions, where the epidemic dynamics follows the distinct patterns exemplified in Fig. 1c.
Fig. 2 shows the impact of changing specific single parameter values on the expected scenarios and on times to critical events, tracking time up to two years.
The area occupied by each region changes depending on the parameter setups.
For example, in the reference setup for the Delta variant (a = 0.79 - the Comirnaty effectiveness on the Delta variant, υ = υ r = 0.004, d = 0.12 - the fraction of never vaccinated in the United Kingdom, ω = 1/500, κ = 1/500, and proportional mixing) in Fig.
2a, the overcritical region (denoted +, with \({{{{{{{{\mathcal{R}}}}}}}}}^{* }\) always above 1) occupies the lower left corner.
This region is enlarged in the case of a lower vaccine effectiveness (a = 0.6 - the effectiveness of Vaxzevira on the Delta variant, Fig. 2b), and higher waning rate (Fig. 2f).
In contrast, it shrinks with a higher vaccination rate (Fig. 2c), indicating that there is a concrete benefit from deploying efficient vaccination programs.
The subcritical region (-, with \({{{{{{{{\mathcal{R}}}}}}}}}^{* }\) always smaller than 1) lies in the opposite corner of the f − f v space, for larger restriction values, and, for a fixed fraction of never-vaccinated d, tends to decrease for setups where the overcritical region increases.
As expected, the switch to a larger fraction of never-vaccinated (to d = 30%, corresponding to the reported fraction in France), increases the overcritical (+) region (Fig. 2e).
But, at the same time, the larger fraction of never-vaccinated increases also the subcritical (-) region.
This is due to the fact that the never-vaccinated are assumed to follow stricter restrictions, compared to VP holders, and therefore their larger fraction can constrain the emergence of the later waves, characteristic of the regions +-+ and -+.
Still, a strategy relying on this effect might be difficult to implement due to the large + region and can lead to undesirable outcomes in practice.
Inside each of the three regions associated with the +-+, -+, +- scenarios in Fig. 1c, the specific parameter settings differ by the time to the critical threshold of interest for that region (the last observed switch between subcritical and overcritical epidemic, which for the +-+ region, for example, is the second critical threshold; see Methods for the computation of the times to critical thresholds).
For the reference setup (Fig. 2a) and the +-+ region, the critical threshold is reached after a minimum ~4 months.
Decreasing the vaccine effectiveness from Comirnaty’s to Vaxzevira’s (Fig.
2b), as well as increasing the waning rate (Fig.
2f)
, leads to overcriticality sooner, after a minimum of ~
2 and ~ 3 months respectively, for low f v values.
Increasing vaccination rate (Fig. 2c) shrinks the +-+ region.
The comparison between proportional and preferential mixing shows the impact of more intense interactions of the VP holders inside of their own group, and less intense contacts of the VP holders with the rest of the population.
With preferential mixing (Fig. 2d), the +-+ region becomes larger and overcriticality is reached even sooner.
This is due to the fact that preferential contacts among VP holders accelerate the emergence of the wave caused by infections of the VP holders.
Seemingly counter-intuitively, increasing the number of never-vaccinated people (Fig. 2e)
shrinks the +-+ region and delays the onset of overcriticality.
This is due to the fact that the onset of overcriticality in the +-+ region depends not only on the intensity of contacts of the VP holders, but also on their fraction in the population; with a larger fraction of never-vaccinated, the fraction of VP holders in the population decreases.
The above analysis of the different regions predicts a possible switch to overcritical epidemic growth for a given parameter setup and, if there is a switch, it provides the time it happens, counting from the onset of the vaccination program.
It does not, however, indicate how fast the overcritical growth will be.
To inform about what growth rates can be eventually expected in the overcritical regime, we compute the asymptotic \({{{{{{{{\mathcal{R}}}}}}}}}^{* }\) (the \({{{{{{{{\mathcal{R}}}}}}}}}^{* }(t)\) for t → ∞, see Methods) for all parameter setups and all combinations of restrictions in the relevant f − f v space.
For a given restriction combination f, the asymptotic \({{{{{{{{\mathcal{R}}}}}}}}}^{* }\) indicates how quickly the infections grow shortly after the restrictions are set to f in the asymptotic state.
For all considered parameter setups, except for the one with high (re-)vaccination rate, and for all except the +- and the - regions, large asymptotic \({{{{{{{{\mathcal{R}}}}}}}}}^{* }\) can be expected, which corresponds to short doubling times (Fig. 2).
This analysis highlights the importance of avoiding the overcritical (+) region, as there the asymptotic \({{{{{{{{\mathcal{R}}}}}}}}}^{* }\) values can even exceed 2 when the restrictions are low.
Comparing Fig.
2 to Supplementary Fig.
S2 shows how the Delta variant worsens all scenarios with respect to the Alpha variant: in all panels of Fig. 2, the Delta variant leads to a considerable expansion of the overcritical region, shrinking of the safe subcritical region, and to consistently larger values of asymptotic \({{{{{{{{\mathcal{R}}}}}}}}}^{* }\).
This is due not only to a higher transmissibility of the Delta variant, but also due to the fact that the considered vaccines have lower effectiveness for this variant, as compared to the Alpha variant.
We further investigate how the expected scenarios, times to critical events (tracking time up to two years), and asymptotic \({{{{{{{{\mathcal{R}}}}}}}}}^{* }\) values are affected by changes of two parameters at once, compared to the reference setup, for the Delta (Supplementary Fig. S3) and the Alpha variant (Supplementary Fig. S4).
The double parameter changes give insight into the possible synergistic and compensatory effects between individual parameter changes.
Compared to the effect of only decreasing the vaccine effectiveness from Comirnaty’s to Vaxzevira’s (Fig. 2b), the effect of jointly decreasing the vaccine effectiveness and increasing the vaccination rate (Supplementary Fig. S3a) indicates that a higher vaccination rate can compensate to some extent for the loss of effectiveness.
Similarly, an increased vaccination rate can counteract increased immunity waning rate (Supplementary Fig. S3e).
The combination of decreased effectiveness and increased immunity waning rate has the worst effect, as it largely increases the overcritical region (+), decreases the subcritical region (-) and accelerates the times to the overcriticality in all other regions (Supplementary Fig. S3c).
Finally, combinations of an increased never-vaccinated fraction with other parameter changes show an interesting mix of effects.
When both the never-vaccinated fraction and the vaccination rate increase, the overcritical (+) region decreases and the subcritical region increases, while the times to overcriticality in the +-+ and the -+ regions increase (Supplementary Fig.
S3d).
Similarly, there is a synergistic effect of the combination of the increased never-vaccinated fraction and the increased immunity waning rate (Supplementary Fig. S3f).
For the Alpha variant, the effects of coupled parameter changes combine the same way as for the Delta variant, but once again it is apparent that, for all the parameter setups we considered, with the Alpha variant much less restrictions are required to avoid epidemic resurgence than with the Delta variant (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Taken together, these results indicate that, unless novel vaccines with higher effectiveness are invented and distributed, and unless much faster and wider vaccination programs are implemented, resulting in much more favorable parameter settings than the realistic ones analyzed here (including those considered optimistic), highly unfavorable infection dynamics are likely to emerge for the Delta variant, and less, but still, for the Alpha variant.
The -+ and +-+ regions in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig.
S3 can seem attractive as restriction policies, because they entail larger freedom for the VP holders; both these regions, however, eventually result in epidemic resurgence and either should be avoided or the time spent in these regions should be very carefully regulated.
For example, if sufficient restrictions are enforced for the rest of the population, the VP holders may initially be granted additional freedoms (larger if the Alpha variant is dominant in the population, and much lower if the Delta variant is dominant), which corresponds to the -+ region.
In this way, an overcritical situation (region +) will be avoided.
However, to prevent the epidemic from becoming overcritical after an initial decline in case numbers, restrictions on VP holders need to be timely increased and adapted, to avoid spending longer time in the -+ region than the time to overcriticality.
Thus, moving out of the -+ region to the +- region with the right timing could be one of possible strategies.
It may, however, be more practical to circumvent many changes of restriction policies over time and it may be fair for everyone to face the same restrictions.
Safe common restrictions, however, corresponding to the parameters on the diagonal in the subcritical (-) region in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs.
S2, S3 and S4, are relatively high, especially those required by the Delta variant, and may therefore cause unrest in the population.
A minimum common restriction level can keep the epidemic subcritical in the long-term
We compute the minimum common restriction level \({f}_{\min }\) for the whole population that would guarantee to avoid an overcritical epidemic in the long-term (for time approaching infinity, Methods):
$${f}_{\min }=\max \left(0,1-1/({R}_{\max }\cdot (1-{V}^{{{{{{{{\rm{as}}}}}}}}}))\right.,$$
where Vas as is the asymptotic fraction of the immunized in the population
$${V}^{{{{{{{{\rm{as}}}}}}}}}=(1-d)\frac{a}{1+\omega /{\upsilon }_{r}}.$$
The resulting values differ depending on the setups of vaccine effectiveness a, revaccination rate υ r , the fraction of never-vaccinated population d and immunity waning rate ω (Table 1).
The minimum common restrictions for the reference setup are equal to \({f}_{\min }=0.69\).
Out of parameter setups with single change compared to the reference, doubled (re-)vaccination speed leads to the lowest possible common restriction level.
Even for this most optimistic setup (high a = 0.79, high υ r = 0.008, low d = 0.12, low ω = 0.002; Table 1 third row) we obtain Vas = 0.6, and \({f}_{\min }=0.62\).
The level of 0.62 restrictions is around twice as high as the level 0.29 that would be required for the Alpha variant (Supplementary Table 1), and is a considerable reduction of freedom compared to before the pandemic.
It is noteworthy that in the long term, to avoid infections rising, minimum common restrictions have to be increased to 0.74 with the larger fraction of never vaccinated d.
Thus, a scenario with a large fraction of the population without immunity gained via vaccination requires long-term high restriction levels, and as such seems politically unfeasible.
Table 1
Asymptotic level of immunization Vas and minimum common restrictions \({f}_{\min }\) for the Delta variant and different parameter setups.
Full size table
When changing two parameters simultaneously in order to assess synergies, we find that a decreased vaccine effectiveness or an increased share of never vaccinated or an increased waning rate can barely be offset by an increase in vaccination speed.
Both a decreased vaccine effectiveness and an increase in the share of never vaccinated in combination with an increased waning rate considerably increase the minimum restriction level that is adequate to ensure resurgence can be avoided.
The latter (increased d, increased ω as compared to the reference) is the most pessimistic of the considered scenarios, with \({f}_{\min }=0.8\).
This analysis highlights the importance of vaccine effectiveness, vaccination speed, but also of the fraction of the never-vaccinated.
Such demanding requirements for stringent minimum common restrictions could be reduced if novel vaccines with higher effectiveness become available, if faster and wider vaccination programs are implemented, and finally, if the never-vaccinated fraction shrinks.
Endemic state analysis reveals the possibility of large daily infection and hospitalization numbers
For a given restriction combination f, the above analyzed asymptotic instantaneous reproduction number \({{{{{{{{\mathcal{R}}}}}}}}}^{* }\) (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs.
S2, S3 and S4) indicates how quickly the infections grow shortly after the restrictions are set to f in the asymptotic state; however, it does not provide insight into the daily infection or hospitalization numbers the system converges to.
To this end, we first compute the daily infection numbers both in the vaccinated and the unvaccinated subpopulations in the endemic state, as functions of the restrictions f for the Delta variant (Fig. 3) and compare it to the scenarios achieved with the Alpha variant (Supplementary Fig. S5).
In contrast to the computation of the instantaneous reproduction number \({{{{{{{{\mathcal{R}}}}}}}}}^{* }\) and its asymptotic values, which is based on the analysis of the linearized system of the ordinary equations in the VAP-SIRS model, the endemic state is based on the computation of the stationary point of the full set of the equations (Supplementary Note 1).
Fig.
3: Daily COVID-19 infection cases in the endemic state for different parameter setups and the Delta variant.
Lower triangles show the daily infection numbers in the vaccinated, and upper triangles in the unvaccinated population in the endemic state of the epidemics, for the relevant f − f v parameter space, where f v ≤ f.
The color scale spans from no more than 10 (yellow) up to 1000 and more daily cases per million people (dark violet).
Parameter setups as well as the black borders that delimit the five regions are defined as in Fig. 2: a Reference setup, with a = 0.79 (corresponding to the effectiveness of the Comirnaty vaccine on the Delta variant), υ = υ r = 0.004, ω = 0.002, d = 0.12 (fraction of never-vaccinated in the United Kingdom) and proportional mixing.
b Setup with a decreased vaccine effectiveness: a = 0.6 (corresponding to the effectiveness of the Vaxzevria vaccine on the Delta variant).
c Setup with an increased vaccination rate: υ = υ r = 0.008.
d Setup with preferential (instead of proportional) mixing.
e Setup with an increased fraction of people who will not get vaccinated: d = 0.3 (fraction of never-vaccinated in France).
f Setup with an increased waning rate: ω = 1/200.
Full size image
For all parameter setups, in all regions apart from the subcritical (-) region, the daily infections in the endemic state will exceed 10 per million, which is the tolerance threshold for efficient test, trace and isolation policy58.
For the setups that correspond to low vaccination effectiveness or short waning time, the endemic state is most unfavorable, as the daily infections can exceed 1000 daily cases per million.
A high (re-)vaccination rate is crucial to expand the safe region (Fig. 3c).
A sharp transition can be seen between favorable and unfavorable parameter setups.
In the endemic state, the daily infection numbers in the vaccinated subpopulation can exceed that of the unvaccinated subpopulation, which underlines the risks of waning immunity.
Considering the parameter setups that arise by changing two parameters at once with respect to the reference setup gives insights about their joint effects, shown in Supplementary Fig. S6; the effect of simultaneous parameter variations is akin to that described earlier for the values of asymptotic \({{{{{{{{\mathcal{R}}}}}}}}}^{* }\) and time to critical thresholds in Supplementary Fig.
S3.
Again, comparison with the endemic infection numbers predicted for the Alpha variant (Supplementary Figs.
S5 and S7) shows that Delta has considerably narrowed opportunities to reduce restrictions for the VP holders, underlining the negative impact of the higher transmissibility of the Delta variant and lower effectiveness of the vaccines on this variant.
Besides the computation of daily infection numbers, we compute daily hospitalization numbers for the Delta (Fig. 4) and Alpha (Supplementary Fig.
S8) variants in the endemic state (see the Supplementary Note 1 for details).
The benefit of vaccination in reducing hospitalizations is striking: for all regions apart from the (-) region, the number of hospitalized cases in the unvaccinated population is roughly an order of magnitude larger than in the vaccinated population.
In addition, the unvaccinated population is even more prone to hospitalization when the fraction of never-vaccinated is larger (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig.
S8c).
This negative effect of the never-vaccinated population fraction is dominant also when double changes of parameter values are considered with respect to the reference setup, both for the Delta (Supplementary Fig. S9) and the Alpha variant (Supplementary Fig.
S10).
Again, the comparison between the Delta and the Alpha variant highlights the deleterious effect of increased transmissibility of the Delta variant.
Clearly, to keep hospitalizations at the same level as for the Alpha variant, the Delta variant requires much stricter restrictions for the VP holders and the rest of the population.
Fig.
4: Daily COVID-19 hospitalized cases in the endemic state for different parameter setups and the Delta variant.
Lower triangles show the daily hospitalized numbers in the vaccinated population, and upper triangles in the unvaccinated population, in the endemic state of the epidemic, for the relevant f − f v parameter space, where f v ≤ f.
The color scale spans from no more than 1 (yellow) up to 100 and more daily hospitalized cases per million people (navy blue).
Parameter setups as well as the black borders that delimit the five regions are defined as in Fig. 2: a Reference setup, with a = 0.79 (corresponding to the effectiveness of the Comirnaty vaccine on the Delta variant), υ = υ r = 0.004, ω = 0.002, d = 0.12 (fraction of never-vaccinated in the United Kingdom) and proportional mixing.
b Setup with a decreased vaccine effectiveness: a = 0.6 (corresponding to the effectiveness of the Vaxzevria vaccine on the Delta variant).
c Setup with an increased vaccination rate: υ = υ r = 0.008.

f Setup with an increased waning rate: ω = 1/200.

The benefit of VPs is larger for the Alpha than for the Delta variant, and strongly depends on the (re-)vaccination rates
The above analysis demonstrates the potential risks of increased infection and hospitalization numbers.
The additional freedom for VP holders can be considered beneficial for society as long as it does not lead to an uncontrolled surge of infections.
Consequently, considering the relevant parameters as f v ≤ f, we estimate the benefit of VPs as a value in [0, 1] given by the fraction of the relevant f − f v parameter space where the asymptotic instantaneous reproduction number satisfies \({{{{{{{{\mathcal{R}}}}}}}}}^{* }\,\le \,1\).
For example, for the Delta variant and the reference setup, the benefit of VPs can be obtained as a fraction of the corresponding upper triangle in Fig. 2, which is colored in white or shades of blue.
The estimated benefit of VPs for the reference parameter setup and the Alpha variant is almost 0.5 (Fig. 5).
Increasing the (re-)vaccination rates has the most positive and the largest impact on the VP benefit, increasing it to around 0.8 for the Alpha variant.
All other considered changes to the reference setup (decreasing the effectiveness of the vaccine, preferential instead of proportional mixing, increased waning rate ω, increasing the fraction of never-vaccinated d) decrease the VP benefit.
Strikingly, for half of the considered parameter setups (the reference setup and setups with single changes to it), the benefit is over two-fold reduced for the Delta variant, as compared to the Alpha variant.
The maximum estimated benefit for the Delta variant is only around 0.23.
In an interactive roundtable held online, four anthropology majors—Elise Lindbergh ’21, Ariana Smith ’21, Brooke Vahos ’21, and Alex Withers ’21—recently discussed their summer research projects.
All of them were affected to some extent by COVID, forcing the students to change their focus or find new ways to collect data.
The students briefly presented on their work and answered questions from the audience, which included professors, students, and relatives.
Visiting Assistant Professor of Anthropology Lauren Kohut, with Assistant Professors of Anthropology Willi Lempert and Shreyas Sreenath, facilitated the colloquium.
The students had research grants from the Matilda and John Riley Fund for Sociology and Anthropology.
Human beings are born pretty helpless, with a lot of developing to do.
And just as you must learn such skills as how to walk, so must your immune system learn to defend against infections.
As time passes, your immune system matures through different stages, much the way you advanced from crawling to standing, walking and running.
This process is one of the reasons scientists study the immune response to a vaccine in different age groups, and why, for example, the COVID-19 vaccines need to be tested separately in children ages 5-11 and those 12-16.
Doctors want to use the vaccine dose that provides the best protection with the fewest side effects.
And that’s going to depend on how the immune system is working based on how developed it is – something you can’t really tell from the outside.
I’m an immunologist, and here’s the way I explain to my pediatric and adult patients how vaccines work in people of all different ages.
Two halves of the immune system
The immune maturing process starts shortly after birth.
When you’re born, your main immune protection comes via antibodies your mother shared through the placenta and breast milk.
They provide what’s called passive immunity.
Newborns’ adaptive immune system – the part of your immune system that will make your own antibodies – isn’t really up and running yet.
The process gets started right away, but it can take years for the adaptive immune system to reach full maturity.
Luckily you’re also born with what’s called the innate immune system – and it lasts throughout your life.
It doesn’t need to learn in order to fight off infections and promote health as the adaptive immune system does.
Without the innate immune system people would get sick a lot faster and more often.
READ MORE:First children receive COVID-19 vaccine as part of national rollout
The innate immune system starts with your skin and mucous membranes.
Should any germs get past those physical barriers, it has enzymes just waiting to break down foreign organisms.
Beyond that there are specialized cells looking for anything that is not you in order to kill intruders, while other cells called phagocytes gobble up invaders.
So the innate immune system is your body’s first responder.
It buys you a bit of time.
Then your adaptive immune system comes in and joins the fight.
When you become immunized via a vaccine or infection, your adaptive immune system starts actively making antibodies of your own.
They’re proteins that act like suction cups and stick to viruses or bacteria to help the body get rid of the germs faster and prevent the infection from spreading.
Antibodies are specialized to recognize and take down a particular intruder.
The adaptive immune system can learn a new infection or recall one that it has not seen in a long time.
Vaccines account for immune development
In the same way an infant will learn to walk even if you don’t secure the stairways and pool areas for them, your immune system can learn to squelch an invading virus without a vaccine – but the chance of injury is much greater.
Vaccines work by triggering the creation of antibodies that will recognize a specific germ and work to fight it off in a safer manner than getting the infection for the first time without it.
How well a vaccine works is a combination of how many antibodies you produce in response to it, how effective they are and the safety of the vaccine.
When researchers work to fine-tune the dosage of a vaccine for different age groups, they need to be aware of what parts of the immune system are online and what parts aren’t fully active in people at each developmental stage.
This is part of the reason some vaccines – such as for COVID-19 – get tested and approved on different schedules for adults, teens, kids and babies.
A number of vaccines for infants are given as a series – meaning they get the same kind of shot several times over the course of a few months.
A baby’s adaptive immune system is prone to being forgetful or not listening at this age – the same way a baby falters as it tries to stand and walk.
With each exposure, every aspect of the immune system gets stronger and better at defending against the would-be infection.
After 4 years of age and through younger adult life, your immune system tends to be more responsive and less prone to forgetting.
It’s not a coincidence that this is when people tend to gain most of their allergies.
For the COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine, researchers found that kids ages 5 to 11 had a similar immune and safety response at one-third the dose used for those ages 12 and up.
Scientists tend to start with patients between ages 18 and 55 years old when studying vaccines.
Their adult immune systems have matured and they can be counted on to reliably report any adverse reactions.
Seeing what happens in the adult age group also helps physicians predict what might occur when a vaccine is administered to others and be on the lookout for these side effects in the younger age groups.
Around age 55 or so, the adaptive immune system starts to become weaker again and forgetful, in some ways more like the infant’s developing system.
Luckily vaccine boosters can provide a quick refresher for these older patients – like helping protect them from accidental falls after a lifetime having mastered walking and running.
In the end, vaccines provide the safest environment for the immune system to learn, and tweaking the dosages for different age groups helps ensure that each patient gets just what’s necessary to get the job done.

Governments worldwide are abandoning people to a debilitating disease with one simple trick: saying it no longer exists.
Part of the Series Despair and Disparity:
The Uneven Burdens of COVID-19
Throughout 2020-2021, I wrote many pieces about COVID in an effort to highlight both the severity of the disease and the failure of capitalist governments to ensure the health and safety of their citizens, especially the most vulnerable of them, in the face of a global pandemic.
I also edited a series, “Dispatches from the Frontlines of Care,” where I tried to center the voices of essential workers during the pandemic.
But I also have a different story to share – something different in both tenor and nature.
The difference between all the other work I have done on COVID and what you will read below is the difference between a prescription and an open wound.

“I have asthma… etc. etc., so I would be very grateful if you all masked in my class.”
Many nod sympathetically, others are indifferent.
“I will supply you with masks,” I say desperately.
Thus begins a two-year relationship with Amazon, where at the end of each week, I buy, with my own money, a box of masks for my students.
Some of my classes are large, and students often forget their masks, so each day of class I supply them with a new one.
And on and on.
And yet, I feel lucky — at least they are not refusing.
Let me rephrase that last sentence: I am made to feel lucky for others observing minimal protections against a debilitating disease.
The effect is, I feel, not unlike the way workers on unconscionably low-wage jobs are made to feel lucky (“at least you have a job”).
Fall 2021:
Numbers and Their Banality
A new group of students.
Another round of abject requests from me to them.
Meanwhile, friends are getting impatient with me, as I still refuse to go into restaurants to eat or to do anything indoors that involves taking my double masks off.
This fall, my child is one of a very, very small handful of students in her high school who are still masking.
I am the only one doing so in my department.
I have not traveled anywhere since January 2020.
When someone masks around me, I am made to feel grateful.
When I request that someone masks, I am made to feel unreasonable.
My home state, Indiana, ranks last on a list of “safest states during COVID-19.”
I read Anne Boyer’s extraordinary book, The Undying.
“The history of illness is not the history of medicine,” writes Boyer, rather, “it’s the history of the world — and the history of having a body could well be the history of what is done to most of us in the interest of the few.”
Why does death get leached of its significance and dread when you plant a large number in front of the word?
I look at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website: on September 4, 2021, a year and half into the pandemic, the CDC records weekly deaths in the U.S. to be 15,493.
By the end of the year, the CDC will record in small letters, and you will have to fine-tune your search to find it: there were a total of 460,000 deaths in the U.S. during January to December 2021.
I find myself wondering: Why does death get leached of its significance and dread when you plant a large number in front of the word?
Spring-Summer-Fall 2022: COVID as a Buzzfeed Listicle
I learn a new phrase from world governments and their pet media sources: “living with COVID.”
The Washington Post puts it best in its widely circulated headline “10 tips for co-existing with COVID (and leading a normal-ish life);” the opening line of the article reads: “Living with COVID can be easy if you take simple, regular precautions.”
The pandemic is over!
It is now like a Buzzfeed listicle!
The CDC is still reporting an average of 4,000 deaths weekly.
Let me rephrase that: Every week, 4,000 people who were mothers, fathers, children, neighbors, grandparents, colleagues, were dying.
They will never again open a window, kiss, laugh at a joke.
The CDC estimates that 31 million working-age Americans have long COVID.
A study, which I don’t understand fully, tells me that the coronavirus has a “wide tropism” and infects human cells via the ACE2 receptor.
People with long COVID are likely to have “cognition problems, affective disorders, heart and pulmonary damage,” and that these symptoms “speak to each other.”
A Dutch survey shows increasing cognitive problems among COVID survivors, some as young as 25.
In the U.S., only if you pledge to die for capitalism, do you get a chance to live.
I feel a certain vertigo before the expanse of these facts.
These days, I often think of the words of scientific philosopher Thomas Kuhn: What one sees “depends both upon what he looks at and also upon what his previous visual-conception experience has taught him to see.”
Facts about long COVID, about COVID deaths, continue to exist as stray facts; some invisible force stops those facts from coalescing into a map, a narrative.
From becoming knowledge.
I go to Target (supermarket) after a long time.
I hear a conversation between two young (early 20s) male (white) employees:
Employee 1: As soon as I heard of COVID, I wanted to have it.
Employee 2: Why?
Employee1: Because if you get COVID, Target gives you three weeks off with full pay, dude!
I am immediately reminded of an Indiana law that if a soldier earned a Purple Heart in war, they were entitled to free education in a state university.
I think, In the U.S., only if you pledge to die for capitalism, do you get a chance to live.
Spring-Summer 2023:
Living With COVID
I look at my notes from January.
Threaded through the words are red lines of anxiety about COVID, the continuing humiliation of having to reveal my medical facts to teenagers and depend on their generosity.
In January of the new year, the CDC records a weekly average of 3,662 deaths.
I wonder: If all these people were millionaires, then would we still say we were over the pandemic?
One night I dream of a pandemic that only kills the rich and people with mismatched eyes.
COVID has yielded the most stunningly pervasive gaslighting phenomenon in recent history.
I lose a beloved person to the war in Ukraine.
I stop comparing defense budgets to money allocated for health.
I begin to realize that “living with COVID” actually means ignoring COVID.
One cue, May 11 marks the end of the federal COVID-19 public health emergency.
I turn back to my notes from February.
I see that I wrote:
The institutional disregard for disabled and vulnerable lives displayed in our COVID policies means that ordinary people, in these last three years, have also been forced to adopt that approach.
Or lose their jobs.
The long-term effects of this deepening culture of casual malice will be with us for a long time, inhibiting empathy, care, and solidarity in many areas of social life.
In June, I finally get COVID.
As does my daughter.
Not because I did not take care, but because others did not.
My throat feels like a hundred knives are being plunged into it as I swallow.
My temperature rises.
Despite such morbid concreteness, COVID now is a phantom disease.
It has become, thanks to capitalist institutions, a matter of personal belief and choices.
When one asks for the minimum protections, even the most sensible individuals shrug and say, “but for how long?”
Those who ask, those who mask, are made to feel that we are demanding impossible things.
COVID has yielded the most stunningly pervasive gaslighting phenomenon in recent history.
Willing and eager governments worldwide are abandoning citizens to a debilitating disease by one simple trick: saying it no longer exists.

In the week ending 13 March 2023, the infection rate increased in the North West, East Midlands and South East, and the trends were uncertain in the North East, Yorkshire and The Humber, West Midlands, East of England, London, and South West.
Uncertainty around regional estimates is higher than for England overall.
In the week ending 19 March 2023, overall hospital admissions of patients with confirmed COVID-19 increased in the North East, Yorkshire and The Humber, East Midlands, London, South East and South West.
In the same week, admission rates decreased in the West Midlands and East of England, and remained similar in the North West.
In the week ending 17 March 2023, deaths involving COVID-19 decreased in the North East, Yorkshire and The Humber, East Midlands, West Midlands, London, and the South East.
In the same week, deaths involving COVID-19 increased in the North West, East of England, and South West.
There is a delay between a person becoming infected with COVID-19 and being admitted to hospital or dying, and this is reflected in the lags in trends.
Deaths figures are the number of deaths registered in the time period.
The number of deaths in each region will be affected by population size and do not necessarily reflect the rate of deaths.

In the period when the Alpha variant was dominant (18 December 2020 to 15 May 2021), the percentage of people testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) peaked across all English regions in January 2021.
During the period when the Delta variant was dominant (22 May to 19 December 2021), the percentage of people testing positive for COVID-19 remained relatively high across all regions from July to December 2021.
The North East was the first English region to reach its peak COVID-19 positivity (3.20% on 21 July 2021).
It was 13 October 2021 before another English region reached its peak positivity estimate (2.24% in the North West).
During the period when the Omicron BA.1 variant was dominant (20 December 2021 to 1 March 2022), London was the English region that had the first peak in COVID-19 positivity (8.79% on 28 December 2021).
All other English regions reached their peaks in January and February 2022.
In the period when the Omicron BA.2 variant was dominant (2 March to 15 June 2022), all English regions peaked at around 7% to 9%, in the 14 days between 23 March and 6 April 2022.
During the period when the:
Alpha variant was dominant, peak positivity across the regions ranged from approximately 1.5% to 3.0%
Delta variant was dominant, peak positivity across the regions ranged from approximately 2.0% to 3.5%
Omicron BA.1 variant was dominant, peak positivity across the regions ranged from approximately 5% to 10%
Omicron BA.2 variant was dominant, peak positivity across the regions ranged from approximately 7% to 9%
Across regions, sub-regions and time periods, different factors have influenced COVID-19 positivity estimates, such as restrictions in place at the time.
This analysis does not account for all of these factors, and therefore should not be considered as providing statistical evidence for differences in positivity estimates.

Share on Pinterest Lisa Lake/Getty Images for Roc Nation Demand for antigen tests has soared since workplaces and schools have reopened and travel has resumed.
President Biden recently announced that rapid at-home COVID-19 testing will become much more widely available in the United States, making it easier and cheaper to access.
Pricing for antigen tests currently ranges between $5 and $50, and they give results in up to 30 minutes.
Although they are not quite as accurate as lab-based PCR tests, rapid antigen tests have comparable accuracy in symptomatic COVID-19 cases.
By December 2021, 200 million rapid tests are expected to be available to Americans each month as part of a drive to make community testing more widespread and accessible.
The announcement came last week with the White House signaling a billion-dollar investment in at-home rapid coronavirus tests.
It also said 20,000 pharmacies across the country would offer free testing starting from September.
We break down what these tests can do, the best times to do them, and list some of the most popular ones on the market.
What are rapid antigen tests?
Rapid tests for COVID-19 are a fast and easy method to detect the coronavirus.
They are similar to a pregnancy test in the sense that they display one or two lines to indicate a result after a few minutes.
If the test detects viral antigens, which are a type of protein on the surface of the virus, it will show positive.
“Rapid tests are are a snapshot of how much virus you are shedding, if any,” said Eric Cioe-Peña, MD, director of global health at Northwell Health in New Hyde Park, New York.
He pointed out a caveat with these tests, it’s possible that if you have been exposed to COVID-19 the coronavirus could be building up in your body and eventually you will start to become contagious.
A negative result indicates that you likely do not have the infection at that moment in time.
“If the [result] is negative, it is usually pretty safe to engage in whatever event you are thinking about engaging in,” Cioe-Peña told Healthline.
How accurate are rapid antigen tests?
If you present with COVID-19 symptoms, and want to see if you have the disease, rapid tests are quite reliable and can offer similar accuracy as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests processed in labs.
Studies have shown that antigen tests have comparable sensitivity to lab tests.
The current “gold standard” for clinically diagnosing COVID-19 is laboratory-based nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) .
Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and PCR tests are the most commonly used NAAT techniques.
While both lab-based tests such as PCR and at-home rapid antigen tests detect a current infection, the former looks for viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) instead of viral antigens.
The sensitivity of rapid antigen tests can change depending on the course of infection and viral load.
A higher viral load, which is usually a few days after infection, usually gives the most accurate results.
If rapid tests fail to detect enough antigens, they may produce a false negative.
This can be because either the test was administered before symptoms appeared or the level of antigens was below the lowest limit the test could detect.
The advantages of rapid tests are that they are cheaper, take less time (compared to 1 or 2 days for PCRs), and are more widely accessible.
Who should get tested?
People who have symptoms of COVID-19, regardless of vaccination status or history of infection, should get tested, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
If you suspect you have been in close contact with someone who had COVID-19, meaning, you were within 6 feet of a person with a confirmed case for 15 minutes or more, it would be a good idea to get tested.
People who have tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 3 months and have recovered do not need to get tested if they do not develop new symptoms.
Anyone who suspects they might have developed COVID-19 can do a rapid antigen test.
When is the best time to do a rapid antigen test?
The CDC says antigen tests perform best in symptomatic people and within a certain number of days after symptoms appear.
If you know you have been exposed to COVID-19, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends testing 3 to 5 days after exposure.
Cioe-Peña says the best time to test is the same day you want to know if you have the infection.
“Ideally, people should test using rapid antigen tests on the same day that they want to know whether they have an infection or not.
The nice thing about rapid antigen tests with the Delta variant is that there are high concentrations of virus when you are shedding particles, so they are likely to turn out positive.”
– Eric Cioe-Peña, MD
In addition, experts say it may be a good idea for people to do rapid tests before going to work or school, visiting family or friends, or attending large gatherings in order to decrease the risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
“Since COVID-19 can potentially result in asymptomatic or presymptomatic infections, individuals may exhibit no symptoms but still be able to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other individuals.
Because of that, it is important to take precautions such as COVID-19 testing before attending gatherings,” said Fred Turner, CEO and co-founder of Curative, a healthcare startup in the Los Angeles area providing testing and vaccinations for COVID-19.
“Many events are choosing to take preventative measures: ensuring all attendees are either vaccinated, recently recovered from infection, or have tested negative for COVID-19 before entering the space and mingling with other attendees,” he said.
Dr. Harrison Lobdell IV, MD, MPH, and a physician with TeamHealth in Austin, Texas, had a slightly different point of view and said the best times to use rapid antigen tests are when you are symptomatic.
If you are exposed to someone with COVID-19 and test negative, he said you may want another test to fully verify your negative result.
“Rapid antigen tests should be used frequently in symptomatic individuals, but negative tests should always be confirmed [with a PCR],” he told Healthline.
How often should I test?
In the United Kingdom, for example, the National Health Service (NHS) recommends people do a rapid antigen test twice a week or every 3 to 4 days to check if they have COVID-19.
Their recommendation is based on data that indicates about 1 in 3 people with COVID-19 do not have symptoms.
Srinivasa Nagalla, MD, founder and CEO of commercial medical diagnostics company Diabetomics in Beaverton, Oregon, recommended people get both antigen and antibody tests once every 2 months, if they can.
“[Antigen tests are] most useful when you have symptoms between 9 and 14 days after exposure to COVID-19,” he said.
Should unvaccinated people approach testing differently?
As younger children remain unvaccinated, experts recommend they get tested periodically before going to school, sports practice, or a birthday party.
The rationale behind routine testing is that if the test misses a low-level infection one day, it is likely that it could detect a high-level infection the next time.
If unvaccinated people are planning on mixing with others who may be at higher risk of COVID-19, such as at a wedding or dinner party, doing a rapid test before the gathering can act as added precaution.
For people who are unvaccinated, Cioe-Peña recommended more frequent testing.
“[They] should get vaccinated if they are eligible.
If they are not eligible, then they should just recognize that any contact with people is a high risk and they should test more frequently,” he said.
Meanwhile, Lobdell pointed out that vaccinated individuals who are exposed to COVID-19 are more likely to remain asymptomatic.
In those instances where a vaccinated person is exposed to someone with COVID-19, he recommended trying to get a PCR tests over antigen tests.
He said unvaccinated people should be sure to quarantine if exposed to COVID-19.
“Unvaccinated individuals should quarantine for 7 days and be tested with RT-PCR if asymptomatic,” he said.
Recombination analysis and identification of breakpoint-free genome regions
Among the 68 sequences in the aligned sarbecovirus sequence set, 67 show evidence of mosaicism (all Dunn–Sidak-corrected P < 4 × 10–4 and 3SEQ14), indicating involvement in homologous recombination either directly with identifiable parentals or in their deeper shared evolutionary history—that is, due to shared ancestral recombination events.
This is evidence for numerous recombination events occurring in the evolutionary history of the sarbecoviruses22,33; specifying all past events in their correct temporal order34 is challenging and not shown here.
Figure 1 (top) shows the distribution of all identified breakpoints (using 3SEQ’s exhaustive triplet search) by the number of candidate recombinant sequences supporting them.
The histogram allows for the identification of non-recombining regions (NRRs) by revealing regions with no breakpoints.
Sorting these breakpoint-free regions (BFRs) by length results in two segments >5 kb: an ORF1a subregion spanning nucleotides (nt) 3,625–9,150 and the first half of ORF1b spanning nt 13,291–19,628 (sequence numbering given in Source Data, https://github.com/plemey/SARSCoV2origins).
Eight other BFRs <500 nt were identified, and the regions were named BFR A–J in order of length.
Of the nine breakpoints defining these ten BFRs, four showed phylogenetic incongruence (PI) signals with bootstrap support >80%, adopting previously published criteria on using a combination of mosaic and PI signals to show evidence of past recombination events19.
All four of these breakpoints were also identified with the tree-based recombination detection method GARD35.

a, Breakpoints identified by 3SEQ illustrated by percentage of sequences (out of 68) that support a particular breakpoint position.
Note that breakpoints can be shared between sequences if they are descendants of the same recombination events.
Pink, green and orange bars show BFRs, with region A (nt 13,291–19,628) showing two trimmed segments yielding region A′ (nt 13,291–14,932, 15,405–17,162, 18,009–19,628).
Regions B and C span nt 3,625–9,150 and 9,261–11,795, respectively.
Concatenated region A′BC is NRR1.

N. China corresponds to Jilin, Shanxi, Hebei and Henan provinces, and the N. China clade also includes one sequence sampled in Hubei Province in 2004.

The extent of sarbecovirus recombination history can be illustrated by five phylogenetic trees inferred from BFRs or concatenated adjacent BFRs (Fig. 1c).
BFRs were concatenated if no phylogenetic incongruence signal could be identified between them.
When viewing the last 7 kb of the genome, a clade of viruses from northern China appears to cluster with sequences from southern Chinese provinces but, when inspecting trees from different parts of ORF1ab, the N. China clade is phylogenetically separated from the S. China clade.
Individual sequences such as RpShaanxi2011, Guangxi GX2013 and two sequences from Zhejiang Province (CoVZXC21/CoVZC45), as previously shown22,25, have strong phylogenetic recombination signals because they fall on different evolutionary lineages (with bootstrap support >80%) depending on what region of the genome is being examined.
Despite the high frequency of recombination among bat viruses, the block-like nature of the recombination patterns across the genome permits retrieval of a clean subalignment for phylogenetic analysis.
Conservatively, we combined the three BFRs >2 kb identified above into non-recombining region 1 (NRR1).
Removal of five sequences that appear to be recombinants and two small subregions of BFR A was necessary to ensure that there were no phylogenetic incongruence signals among or within the three BFRs.
Alternatively, combining 3SEQ-inferred breakpoints, GARD-inferred breakpoints and the necessity of PI signals for inferring recombination, we can use the 9.9-kb region spanning nucleotides 11,885–21,753 (NRR2) as a putative non-recombining region; this approach is breakpoint-conservative because it is conservative in identifying breakpoints but not conservative in identifying non-recombining regions.
Using a third consensus-based approach for identifying recombinant regions in individual sequences—with six different recombination detection methods in RDP5 (ref.
36)—gives a putative recombination-free alignment that we call non-recombinant alignment 3 (NRA3) (see Methods).
All three approaches to removal of recombinant genomic segments point to a single ancestral lineage for SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13.
Two other bat viruses (CoVZXC21 and CoVZC45) from Zhejiang Province fall on this lineage as recombinants of the RaTG13/SARS-CoV-2 lineage and the clade of Hong Kong bat viruses sampled between 2005 and 2007 (Fig. 1c).
Specifically, progenitors of the RaTG13/SARS-CoV-2 lineage appear to have recombined with the Hong Kong clade (with inferred breakpoints at 11.9 and 20.8 kb) to form the CoVZXC21/CoVZC45-lineage.
Sibling lineages to RaTG13/SARS-CoV-2 include a pangolin sequence sampled in Guangdong Province in March 2019 and a clade of pangolin sequences from Guangxi Province sampled in 2017.
Because the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has been implicated in past recombination events or possibly convergent evolution12, we specifically investigated several subregions of the S protein—the N-terminal domain of S1, the C-terminal domain of S1, the variable-loop region of the C-terminal domain, and S2.
The variable-loop region in SARS-CoV-2 shows closer identity to the 2019 pangolin coronavirus sequence than to the RaTG13 bat virus, supported by phylogenetic inference (Fig. 2).
On first examination this would suggest that that SARS-CoV-2 is a recombinant of an ancestor of Pangolin-2019 and RaTG13, as proposed by others11,22.
However, on closer inspection, the relative divergences in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2, bottom) show that SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to have acquired the variable loop from an ancestor of Pangolin-2019 because these two sequences are approximately 10–15% divergent throughout the entire S protein (excluding the N-terminal domain).
It is RaTG13 that is more divergent in the variable-loop region (Extended Data Fig. 1) and thus likely to be the product of recombination, acquiring a divergent variable loop from a hitherto unsampled bat sarbecovirus28.
This is notable because the variable-loop region contains the six key contact residues in the RBD that give SARS-CoV-2 its ACE2-binding specificity27,37.
These residues are also in the Pangolin Guangdong 2019 sequence.
The most parsimonious explanation for these shared ACE2-specific residues is that they were present in the common ancestors of SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13 and Pangolin Guangdong 2019, and were lost through recombination in the lineage leading to RaTG13.
This provides compelling support for the SARS-CoV-2 lineage being the consequence of a direct or nearly-direct zoonotic jump from bats, because the key ACE2-binding residues were present in viruses circulating in bats.
Fig.
2: Phylogenetic relationships among SARS-CoV-2 and closely related sequences for subregions of the S protein.
SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are the most closely related (their most recent common ancestor nodes denoted by green circles), except in the 222-nt variable-loop region of the C-terminal domain (bar graphs at bottom).
In the variable-loop region, RaTG13 diverges considerably with the TMRCA, now outside that of SARS-CoV-2 and the Pangolin Guangdong 2019 ancestor, suggesting that RaTG13 has acquired this region from a more divergent and undetected bat lineage.
The genetic distances between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 (bottom) demonstrate that their relationship is consistent across all regions except for the variable loop.
The genetic distances between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin Guangdong 2019 are consistent across all regions except the N-terminal domain, implying that a recombination event between these two sequences in this region is unlikely.
Uncertainty measures are shown in Extended Data Fig.

Ancestry in non-recombinant regions
Using the most conservative approach to identification of a non-recombinant genomic region (NRR1), SARS-CoV-2 forms a sister lineage with RaTG13, with genetically related cousin lineages of coronavirus sampled in pangolins in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces (Fig. 3).
Given that these pangolin viruses are ancestral to the progenitor of the RaTG13/SARS-CoV-2 lineage, it is more likely that they are also acquiring viruses from bats.
While pangolins could be acting as intermediate hosts for bat viruses to get into humans—they develop severe respiratory disease38 and commonly come into contact with people through trafficking—there is no evidence that pangolin infection is a requirement for bat viruses to cross into humans.

Region A has been shortened to A′ (5,017 nt) based on potential recombination signals within the region.
Region B is 5,525 nt long.
Sequences are colour-coded by province according to the map.
Five example sequences with incongruent phylogenetic positions in the two trees are indicated by dashed lines.
Full size image
Phylogenies of subregions of NRR1 depict an appreciable degree of spatial structuring of the bat sarbecovirus population across different regions (Fig. 3).
One geographic clade includes viruses from provinces in southern China (Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangdong), with its major sister clade consisting of viruses from provinces in northern China (Shanxi, Henan, Hebei and Jilin) as well as Hubei Province in central China and Shaanxi Province in northwestern China.
Several of the recombinant sequences in these trees show that recombination events do occur across geographically divergent clades.
The Sichuan (SC2018) virus appears to be a recombinant of northern/central and southern viruses, while the two Zhejiang viruses (CoVZXC21 and CoVZC45) appear to carry a recombinant region from southern or central China.
TMRCA for NRRs of SARS-CoV-2 lineage
To avoid artefacts due to recombination, we focused on NRR1 and NRR2 and the recombination-masked alignment NRA3 to infer time-measured evolutionary histories.
Visual exploration using TempEst39 indicates that there is no evidence for temporal signal in these datasets (Extended Data Fig. 2).
This is not surprising for diverse viral populations with relatively deep evolutionary histories.
In such cases, even moderate rate variation among long, deep phylogenetic branches will substantially impact expected root-to-tip divergences over a sampling time range that represents only a small fraction of the evolutionary history40.
However, formal testing using marginal likelihood estimation41 does provide some evidence of a temporal signal, albeit with limited log Bayes factor support of 3 (NRR1), 10 (NRR2) and 3 (NRA3); see Supplementary Table 1.
In the absence of a strong temporal signal, we sought to identify a suitable prior rate distribution to calibrate the time-measured trees by examining several coronaviruses sampled over time, including HCoV-OC43, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV virus genomes.
These datasets were subjected to the same recombination masking approach as NRA3 and were characterized by a strong temporal signal (Fig. 4), but also by markedly different evolutionary rates.
Specifically, using a formal Bayesian approach42 (see Methods), we estimate a fast evolutionary rate (0.00169 substitutions per site yr–1, 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval (0.00131,0.00205)) for SARS viruses sampled over a limited timescale (1 year), a slower rate (0.00078 (0.00063,0.00092) substitutions per site yr–1) for MERS-CoV on a timescale of about 4 years and the slowest rate (0.00024 (0.00019,0.00029) substitutions per site yr–1) for HCoV-OC43 over almost five decades.
These differences reflect the fact that rate estimates can vary considerably with the timescale of measurement, a frequently observed phenomenon in viruses known as time-dependent evolutionary rates41,43,44.
Over relatively shallow timescales, such differences can primarily be explained by varying selective pressure, with mildly deleterious variants being eliminated more strongly by purifying selection over longer timescales44,45,46.
Consistent with this, we estimate a concomitantly decreasing non-synonymous-to-synonymous substitution rate ratio over longer evolutionary timescales: 1.41 (1.20,1.68), 0.35 (0.30,0.41) and 0.133 (0.129,0.136) for SARS, MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43, respectively.
In light of these time-dependent evolutionary rate dynamics, a slower rate is appropriate for calibration of the sarbecovirus evolutionary history.
We compare both MERS-CoV- and HCoV-OC43-centred prior distributions (Extended Data Fig. 3) to examine the sensitivity of date estimates to this prior specification.

We infer time-measured evolutionary histories using a Bayesian phylogenetic approach while incorporating rate priors based on mean MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 rates and with standard deviations that allow for more uncertainty than the empirical estimates for both viruses (see Methods).
Using both prior distributions, this results in six highly similar posterior rate estimates for NRR1, NRR2 and NRA3, centred around 0.00055 substitutions per site yr–1.
The fact that these estimates lie between the rates for MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 is consistent with the intermediate sampling time range of about 18 years (Fig. 5).
The consistency of the posterior rates for the different prior means also implies that the data do contribute to the evolutionary rate estimate, despite the fact that a temporal signal was visually not apparent (Extended Data Fig. 2).
Below, we report divergence time estimates based on the HCoV-OC43-centred rate prior for NRR1, NRR2 and NRA3 and summarize corresponding estimates for the MERS-CoV-centred rate priors in Extended Data Fig. 4.
Divergence time estimates based on the HCoV-OC43-centred rate prior for the separate BFRs (Supplementary Table 3) show consistency in TMRCA estimates across the genome.

Full size image
The divergence time estimates for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV from their respective most closely related bat lineages are reasonably consistent among the three approaches we use to eliminate the effects of recombination in the alignment.
Using the most conservative approach (NRR1), the divergence time estimate for SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is 1969 (95% HPD: 1930–2000), while that between SARS-CoV and its most closely related bat sequence is 1962 (95% HPD: 1932–1988); see Fig. 5.
These are in general agreement with estimates using NRR2 and NRA3, which result in divergence times of 1982 (1948–2009) and 1948 (1879–1999), respectively, for SARS-CoV-2, and estimates of 1952 (1906–1989) and 1970 (1932–1996), respectively, for the divergence time of SARS-CoV from its closest known bat relative.
The SARS-CoV divergence times are somewhat earlier than dates previously estimated15 because previous estimates were obtained using a collection of SARS-CoV genomes from human and civet hosts (as well as a few closely related bat genomes), which implies that evolutionary rates were predominantly informed by the short-term SARS outbreak scale and probably biased upwards.
Indeed, the rates reported by these studies are in line with the short-term SARS rates that we estimate (Fig. 4).
The estimated divergence times for the pangolin virus most closely related to the SARS-CoV-2/RaTG13 lineage range from 1851 (1730–1958) to 1877 (1746–1986), indicating that these pangolin lineages were acquired from bat viruses divergent to those that gave rise to SARS-CoV-2.
Current sampling of pangolins does not implicate them as an intermediate host.
Before she came down with COVID in March 2020, Rebekah Stein was able to enjoy a handful of alcoholic drinks a week.
She assumed nothing had changed after her mild infection, so when she saw her husband holding an enticing glass of whiskey one night, she took a tiny sip.
Within a minute, severe chest pain kicked in, and Stein, 30, became so drunk it felt like she had downed several drinks at once.
The next day was worse, but it wasn’t your average hangover: She had an irregular heartbeat, chest pain, cough, sore throat, headache, and stuffy nose.
It was “basically COVID relapse,” said Stein, who’s also dealing with other long COVID symptoms, including shortness of breath, regular fevers, full body aches, and exhaustion.
“When this was first occurring, I hadn’t connected the dots.
I would wake up and take a COVID test because I had all the COVID symptoms, and when I drink my heart rate gets really high overnight,” Stein said.
“My body seems to know it’s being poisoned pretty quickly.”
Nearly three years later, Stein still cannot drink alcohol of any kind.
And she isn’t alone.
Post-COVID alcohol intolerance has not been studied yet, so no one knows how common it actually is, but interviews with doctors, researchers, and people who are no longer able to drink alcohol suggest it’s yet another mysterious symptom that could be a side effect of the viral infection.
Long COVID, also known as post-COVID conditions , occurs when health problems last for weeks, months or even years after a coronavirus infection.
It was recognized by the American With Disabilities Act in 2021 and roughly 30% of adults may experience at least one COVID symptom that lasts three months or more, according to research.
Dr. Stuart Malcolm, an internal medicine physician who solely treats long COVID patients at the RTHM clinic, said many people with long COVID have given up alcohol entirely “because it seems to universally not make people feel well.”
But he estimates that about 5% to 10% of his patients (or about 10 to 20 people in his practice) are experiencing this intolerance as they continue to experiment with alcohol consumption.
A neurologist with long COVID in Louisiana also wrote about her experience with it in a March 2021 blog post, and a Reddit thread from last February revealed more people dealing with the same problem.
Alcohol intolerance can happen even to those who aren’t experiencing long COVID, may disappear or become less severe with time, and can be triggered by specific types of alcohol but not others.
Although inconvenient, not being able to drink alcohol isn't the most earth-shattering of symptoms compared with more serious effects.
Still, experts, particularly those who study or treat people with ME/CFS (myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome) — a complex illness that shares many similarities with long COVID — aren’t too shocked to hear about the occurrence.
Alcohol intolerance is actually a key diagnostic feature of ME/CFS .
Studies have found that it shows up in anywhere between 65% to 80% of people with the illness.
“It doesn't surprise me at all because we now know there are all sorts of underlying biological abnormalities in people with ME/CFS that involve the immune system, energy metabolism, brain, autonomic nervous system, and microbiome of the gut, most of which now are showing up in people with long COVID,” said Dr. Anthony Komaroff, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who has studied ME/CFS for 35 years.
“But what specifically the abnormalities are that lead to alcohol intolerance we don't know yet.”
What is alcohol intolerance?
Alcohol intolerance is generally an inherited metabolic disorder that prevents people from processing alcohol the way other people do; a genetic mutation makes a specific enzyme, or protein, less efficient at converting alcohol into a non-toxic substance, causing a buildup of toxins in the blood.
As a result, people’s face, neck, and chest become flushed — warm and pink or red in color — almost immediately after drinking alcohol.
They may also experience stuffy nose, nausea, vomiting, rapid heartbeat, low blood pressure, headache, diarrhea, and worsening asthma.
The condition doesn’t go away, but people can manage it by avoiding booze of all kinds.
People of Asian descent are more likely to have the genetic mutation, so they have the condition at greater rates compared with other racial groups.
Although it might feel like it, alcohol intolerance doesn’t make people get drunk faster, and it doesn’t increase blood alcohol levels.
The condition is also different from an alcohol allergy, which is an immune response to a chemical, grain, or preservative in alcohol that can cause rashes, itchiness, swelling, and stomach cramps.
Both conditions can cause nausea, but an alcohol allergy is typically more painful and can be life-threatening if untreated.
When it’s related to long COVID or another chronic condition, however, alcohol intolerance likely harms the body through a different chemical mechanism that doesn’t involve an inherited genetic mutation or allergy, Komaroff said.
It’s also possible the coronavirus may directly affect the enzymes responsible for processing alcohol, said Dr. Vikrant Rachakonda, a hepatologist, gastroenterologist, and professor of medicine at UC Davis Health.
But that remains to be seen.
Why do some people have alcohol intolerance after COVID?
There are several plausible explanations behind post-COVID alcohol intolerance, but it has not been thoroughly studied.
Most speculations are based on what scientists have learned about long COVID’s impacts on the body and research on ME/CFS.
Given how complex long COVID is, it’s unlikely that just one of these theories can fully explain what’s going on.
Here are three of the main ones, according to experts.
Liver damage
The liver processes everything we consume, including alcohol, so when the organ is injured or weakened in any way, it becomes vulnerable to further injury when exposed to toxins, like alcohol, Komaroff said.
COVID can injure the liver in more ways than one, and some experts, like Malcolm, the long COVID doctor, suspects the disease causes “a little bit more injury to the liver than we thought that’s not apparent in standard lab tests.
"
That’s all to say that an injured liver — or an undiagnosed liver disease, which Rachakonda says is very common because most cases are symptomless — likely won’t process alcohol as it should.
It’s possible that people who cannot tolerate alcohol after COVID may have sustained an acute liver injury from their infection or have an undiagnosed liver condition.
Rachakonda said it’s not unreasonable to request a blood test if you’re experiencing alcohol intolerance.
Checking your liver enzymes, as well as your kidney function and electrolytes, can help rule out any other causes.
Mast cell activation
Mast cells are a type of immune cell that cause allergic reactions when they detect an allergen like proteins from peanuts.
They do this by releasing a chemical called histamine, which works to get rid of the allergen by making you itchy, sneeze, nauseous, short of breath, etc.
(Komaroff actually suspects alcohol intolerance post-COVID might even be a “kind of allergic reaction.”)
Studies show that long COVID exacerbates this process by activating mast cells, encouraging them to release extra histamine into the body.
(ME/CFS also does this.)
It can mimic the symptoms of mast cell activation syndrome , a condition that causes people to have repeated episodes of anaphylaxis-like symptoms, such as hives, low blood pressure, severe diarrhea, and difficulty breathing.
(Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction.)
Making matters worse, alcohol not only contains histamine — it’s a byproduct of the fermentation and brewing process — but it also pushes mast cells to release more of it and then blocks an enzyme called the DAO enzyme from breaking histamine down.
“It’s kind of a triple whammy,” Malcolm said.
All the extra histamine may explain why some people feel terrible after drinking alcohol post-COVID.
This theory can also help explain why alcohol intolerance may disappear or become less severe over time.
As your body clears the virus and begins to recover from the injuries it caused, there’s less chaos triggering your mast cells to release extra histamine.
That may be what happened to 26-year-old Serena Quinlan.
When she got COVID in February 2021, she experienced loss of taste and smell for several weeks, which included a weird aversion to foods like onions and guacamole.
However, after some nights out with friends and solo wine nights at home that involved only a couple drinks, Quinlan noticed her body acting as if she had at least eight, she told BuzzFeed News.
“For the rest of that spring and summer, I just really, really struggled if I had one drink.
I would wake up so hungover, terrible headaches, and super tired,” said Quinlan, a law student in Tennessee.
“It was so bizarre.”
Her friend who initially gave her COVID experienced the same symptoms: “She texted me on her own and asked me if I was also dying every time I drank alcohol,” Quinlan said.
After three months, her alcohol intolerance disappeared completely.
Blood flow issues
Many long COVID patients (along with ME/CFS patients) experience issues with their autonomic nervous system, which plays a critical role in how blood vessels constrict and dilate, but researchers don’t yet fully understand why.
When someone has long COVID or ME/CFS, their blood vessels can’t properly respond to signals from the brain to tighten or loosen up.
This is why many people with long COVID feel lightheaded or even faint after standing up, as their blood vessels don’t constrict enough, causing blood pressure to drop.
It’s a hallmark symptom of POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome), which about 2% to 14% of people who test positive for COVID end up developing .
Now consider alcohol.
Alcohol widens your blood vessels even more, further decreasing blood pressure.
“If you've already got a loose hose that isn't responding to the signal to tighten up and you're making it looser with alcohol, that's going to worsen those symptoms,” including fatigue, rapid heartbeat, cognitive impairment, and more, Malcolm said.
This increased blood flow could also explain the intense body pain some people with long COVID or ME/CFS experience, according to Sarah Annesley, a microbiology senior research fellow at La Trobe University in Australia who studies both conditions.
Julie Harmon knows this sensation all too well.
About a month after getting COVID in December 2020, she began to feel tingling, numbness, aches, and pain throughout her entire body.
It wasn’t until the summer when Harmon, 39, noticed her alcohol intolerance.
A half-hour after drinking one beer, her face would flush and her hands would hurt so much that she couldn’t hold a book or phone, or “do regular daily things,” Harmon told BuzzFeed News.
“My first few drinks, I was like, ‘oh well, this is just my long COVID pain.’
But when I would have a glass of wine with dinner, I'd feel terrible again,” the Arkansas resident said.
“So it finally dawned on me that even small sips of alcoholic drinks were exasperating my symptoms quite a lot.”
Harmon now avoids alcohol entirely.
What to do if you are experiencing alcohol intolerance after COVID
It’s safe to say an intolerance to alcohol isn’t the worst of COVID or long COVID symptoms, but it can take away the “happy” in happy hour and generally impact your social life (if it revolves around alcohol at all).
The good news is that you can avoid alcohol intolerance by avoiding booze altogether.
You’ll also want to avoid drinking alcohol when taking certain medications , as some drugs can worsen symptoms of alcohol intolerance.
Taking antihistamine medication is another no-go because it may hide some symptoms and lead you to drink more.
Otherwise, Malcolm suggests drinking plenty of water to stay hydrated and possibly pursuing some blood work to better understand what may be causing your symptoms.
A low histamine diet could help too, which excludes most fermented products like wine, beer, and cured cheese.
Some other foods to consider avoiding include fish, tomatoes, spinach, citrus fruits, eggs, and chocolate.
But ditching alcohol really is your best bet, Malcolm said: “The hard part is that alcohol is such a social thing, but try to find something else that can help you relax.”

RALEIGH, N.C. (WTVD) -- Ahead of the back-to-school season, doctors are urging families to take precautions now to ward off respiratory viruses.
COVID-19 metrics are seeing an uptick in North Carolina.
More than 26 million virus particles were found in North Carolina wastewater last week; six times more than the amount detected two months ago, according to data from the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS).
The number of patients admitted to a hospital for COVID-19 is also increasing.
More than 400 patients were admitted statewide; this is the sixth week of increase and the highest number of patients since March.
Despite the recent uptick, the state's metrics remain significantly lower than last August -- when the state had 1,259 COVID-19 patients in the hospital.

COVID-19 cases are increasing in North Carolina and across the country.
The presence of the virus in wastewater has increased by five-fold.
North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services State Epidemiologist Dr. Zack Moore said this increase isn't surprising and he doesn't predict any stricter restrictions will be put in place.
"We know COVID is going to rise and fall, but the big difference now is that we have effective tools to manage that, more like we manage other respiratory viruses, flu, etc.," Moore said.
The state is still only detecting a handful of flu and RSV cases.
The latest data showed 14 people were admitted to the hospital last week for the flu.
NCDHHS data also shows the number of people arriving at the emergency department with flu and RSV symptoms has remained low for months.
"I think the thing to do is do everything you can now to prepare yourself be ready when those viruses hit so that we don't end up in a situation where we have a lot more illness and where our hospitals and health care system get stretched again," Moore recommended.
A new COVID-19 vaccine is expected out this fall, but the exact timeline is still unknown.
The vaccine is designed to better target Omicron variants.

CDC reveals new vaccine recommendations for COVID-19, flu, RSV
The CDC has made some slight changes to its recommendations for vaccinations related to COVID-19, flu, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
"When they're going back to school.
Vaccinations are, of course, the best line of defense that we have for COVID and influenza.
So if you have kids who haven't had the COVID vaccinations yet, we would encourage that," Moore said.
Moore suggested anyone who is at high risk or has a high-risk family member get a COVID-19 booster now rather than waiting for the updated version.
For everyone else, he recommends waiting for the updated version.
As for Flu vaccines, Josef's Pharmacy manager Jonathan Harward said they have started to get some doses of vaccines but are still waiting on double doses.
The CDC recommends people get flu vaccines in September or October.
"We haven't seen much flu yet, so I think there's still plenty of time there for people to protect themselves," Moore said.
RSV vaccines for people 60 years and up are also expected out soon.
"We spoke with our vaccine distributor yesterday and we're hopeful to be able to have that in the next month or so," Harward said.
He said it is still too soon to know just how severe this respiratory season will be, so he recommends everyone prepare now.
Moore also recommends people stock up on COVID-19 tests now and stay home if they detect any symptoms.

HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong residents are becoming increasingly annoyed with the administration’s insistence on sticking to China’s “zero-COVID” strategy as the city posted another record number of cases Wednesday, bristling at ever-stricter regulations and a plan to test everyone for the virus.
Schools have already switched to online learning and summer holidays are being moved forward so that the buildings can be used as facilities for testing, isolation and vaccination.
Hong Kong says it will go ahead with the plan to test every one of its 7.5 million residents three times in March.
Under the “zero-COVID-19" strategy, every person testing positive case must be quarantined in a hospital or other government facility for 14 days regardless of symptoms.
It’s in contrast with most countries, which are reducing restrictions and allowing people with mild or no symptoms to remain at home.
“The whole world knows we have to live with the virus, only the Hong Kong government does not know,” said taxi driver Chan Tai-man.
“Actually it’s not that they don’t know, they only do what the Chinese government tells them to.”
With hospitals in Hong Kong already overwhelmed, construction crews from mainland China are being sent to build new isolation units and the city was moving to convert hotels, halls, indoor stadiums and other quarantine locations, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said.
Chinese medical teams were also building mobile testing laboratories to help prepare Hong Kong for the launch of the mass testing.
“Everybody is now predicting that we will have a pretty sizeable percentage of people infected with COVID-19 in Hong Kong, so hopefully through comprehensive universal testing we will try to identify these infected cases and put them in isolation,” Lam told reporters Tuesday night.
“To ensure the success, we need a lot more isolation facilities.”
Leung Chun-kit, a kitchen worker, said he didn’t think the government was prepared for universal testing and dealing with the results.
“I think the government should consider increasing hospital manpower and facilities to better support the health workers,” he said.
In his presentation of the city budget on Wednesday, Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced a series of measures to provide relief to residents and small businesses, as well as resources to fight the pandemic.
After keeping the coronavirus largely at bay with extremely strict regulations on international travel and internal restrictions, Hong Kong has seen record numbers of new cases fueled by the highly contagious omicron variant.
Last week the daily figure climbed to more than 6,000 confirmed cases for the first time, then hit more than 7,000 earlier this week.
On Wednesday, Hong Hong reported 8,674 cases.
The analysis of sewage samples suggest the real number could be far greater, with experts predicting that the citywide testing could catch some 300,000 cases.
“We probably have not seen the peak of this wave, so how we are going to manage the next two to three months will be extremely essential and critical to containing, but there is no guarantee whatsoever,” Lam said.
Currently 68% of Hong Kong’s population is fully vaccinated and another 10% has had one shot, according to Our World in Data.
As part of its zero-tolerance strategy, China has locked down entire cities, keeping people sequestered in their homes and providing them with food and supplies during extensive testing and contact tracing.
Hong Kong, a former British colony and semi-autonomous region of China, lacks the resources for a complete lockdown but there is growing fear among residents that it is going in that direction.
Smaller lockdowns of single buildings or city blocks have raised vehement criticism.
Hong Kong operates under the “one country, two systems” principle within China, but the mainland has been exerting ever-increasing authority.
Lam insisted “there is no instruction from the Central People’s Government on a lockdown” and that the current outbreak was “entirely a matter” for her administration to handle.
“Our motherland is giving us all the support that we need at this critical stage,” she said.
“But at the end of the day, I am responsible under ‘one country, two systems.’”
China on Wednesday reported 90 new cases of domestic transmission, almost half in the northern Inner Mongolia region and 10 in Beijing.
Shenzhen in Guangdong province, which borders Hong Kong, reported seven new cases.
Guangdong also recorded 38 imported cases, all from Hong Kong, despite strict border controls that have virtually severed travel between Hong Kong and the mainland.
Addressing the surge in Hong Kong on Monday, China’s leading epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan said strict control measures were needed to prevent a higher death rate among the elderly.
Mainland China has lifted lockdowns on millions of people in cities in the north and center of the country, but continues to impose quarantines and require mass testing in districts where cases have been reported.
Practically for Lam, relaxing the zero-COVID-19 strategy would further hinder travel between the city and the mainland, where authorities require three weeks of quarantine or more.
Beijing will not reopen Hong Kong’s border with the mainland until the city reaches and maintains zero cases.
Hong Kong already is operating under its strictest curbs on travel, business and public activity since the pandemic began.
In place since Feb. 10, they also prohibit gatherings of more than two households.
Restaurants, hair salons and religious sites were ordered closed.
Those restrictions are expected to be tightened further on Thursday, the same day the government rolls out a new app to control access to specified venues.
The app will contain the user’s vaccination records and only residents who have had at least one shot, or certain specified medical exemptions, will be allowed to enter places like restaurants, malls and supermarkets.
“If Hong Kong still has to live the zero-COVID policy and then cannot achieve it, then Hong Kong would become an island because it basically will be cut off from the rest of the world, including China, and we already see the escalation in price of vegetables,” said Francis Lun, the CEO of Geo Securities in Hong Kong.
“In addition, the status of Hong Kong as an international financial center would suffer.”

New Site Triples Vaccination Appointments for MTA Employees & Complements MTA Vaccination Efforts at Jacob K. Javits Center
More Than 10,000 MTA Workers Have Received the Vaccine to Date
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) today announced the launch of a new dedicated COVID-19 vaccination site for employees in Downtown Brooklyn.
Beginning tomorrow, as many as 200 MTA employees per day will be able to get the COVID-19 vaccination on site at NYCT's 130 Livingston St– effectively tripling the number of transit workers who will be able to get the vaccine at an MTA location.
Currently, 100 transit workers a day have been receiving the vaccination at the Jacob K. Javits Center.
To mark the launch of the new site, senior MTA officials joined five transit workers and executives from Mobile Health—the company administering the vaccine—for a kickoff event in Brooklyn today.
MTA Chairman and CEO Patrick Foye and each of the five transit workers present received their first of two vaccine doses.
"Our employees heroically moved this city during its most challenging hour," said MTA Chairman and CEO Patrick Foye.
"Today is about making sure that those efforts are honored.
While over 10,000 Transit workers have already received the vaccine, we still have a long way to go as supply continues to increase and this new site will help us get shots in the arms of our employees faster.
This is a great day for our workforce and for the entire city.
The heroes who moved heroes throughout the darkest days of this pandemic are now going to be able to do their jobs without the fear of getting this dangerous virus.
"
"Today is a special day for our workforce," said New York City Transit Interim President Sarah Feinberg.
"Our employees have kept this system running through the most challenging year in New York City Transit history and we have lost more than 148 of our brothers and sisters.
The arrival of the vaccine at a New York City Transit work location represents what I hope is the start of better days for our workforce.
I thank them for their sacrifice and commitment to keeping this city going during its bleakest moment and for providing essential service to the healthcare workers who have fought to save lives throughout the pandemic.
"
"We are proud to partner with the MTA in their efforts to make sure our city's heroic transit workers can get the vaccine," said Mobile Health CEO Andrew Shulman.
"We launched this company right here in New York City nearly four decades ago and remain deeply rooted here.
We rely on the MTA to transport our employees and we're thrilled that they can now rely on us to safely vaccinate their employees.
"
The vaccination center is open on an appointment-only basis, Wednesday through Sunday for 12 hours at a time, with 200 appointment slots for first doses available daily.
Employees will receive the Pfizer vaccine at no cost.
Approximately 10,000 MTA workers have received a vaccination to date.
An interdisciplinary team
The research was made possible through the work of an interdisciplinary team led by UNMC and its Global Center for Health Security:
Bagalkot: Health minister Sreeramulu assured that there will be no issue in providing the necessary medical equipment and supplies for the Covid-19 pandemic.
He chaired a meeting of district level officials in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic at the DC’s office conference hall on Wednesday.
He said,“Not a single positive case has been found in the district so far.
Action will be taken if anyone tests positive for Covid-19 in the future.”
Bagalkot city MLA Veeranna Charantimath said that a demand has been made for necessary medical supplies and equipment to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic.
They should be dispatched immediately, he said.
Charantimath said that each district should have a testing centre for Covid-19, instead of sending swabs to Bengaluru.
“There is not a single laboratory in North Karnataka where a person can get tested for Covid-19.
Even though the government made an announcement about setting up a laboratory at Hubballi and Belgavi, but they are yet to be opened.
”After
the meeting, Sreeramulu visited the district hospital and inspected the special wards set up for Covid-19 patients.

CAMP CARROLL, South Korea -- Teams at the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Center-Korea, working in collaboration with the Defense Logistics Agency, began receiving, storing and distributing the COVID-19 vaccine on Dec. 25.
USAMMC-K, the theater lead agent for medical materiel, exercised its role under direction of U.S. Forces Korea leadership to track thousands of doses of the vaccine and ancillary support kits through customs and into the region.
USFK started inoculating military and civilian health care workers, first responders and command team members on Dec. 29, including USFK Commander Gen. Robert B. Abrams.
Teams distributed remaining vaccines and kits to joint forces at Camp Humphreys, Osan Air Base and Kunsan Air Base.
“From start to finish, the reception, storage, distribution and recovery of equipment was executed flawlessly,” USAMMC-K Commander Lt. Col. Marcus D. Perkins said.
“The plan and timeline briefed to USFK and 8th Army was followed and executed without any required deviation.”
Perkins credited the efforts of Capt. Benjamin Lee, theater pharmacy consultant for the Korean Peninsula, and Maj. William J. Wiltbank, USAMMC-K’s deputy commander, for anticipating the mission requirements and ensuring the team was ready to go when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave emergency use authorization and vaccine shipments arrived.
The vaccine requires strict cold-chain management to keep transit and storage temperatures between minus-15 and minus-25 degrees Celsius at all times.
To prepare for the mission, USAMMC-K Soldiers took part in training on Dec. 15 to ensure proper operation of “freeze-cold” mobile cooling systems for storage and transportation.
“It is important to store and transport the vaccine between minus-25 and minus-15 degrees Celsius to prevent losing the vaccine’s effectiveness and potency,” Lee said.
The mobile freezers can maintain a temperature of minus-22 degrees Celsius, or minus-7.6 degrees Fahrenheit, for more than eight hours when batteries are fully charged.
“This was a whole-of-government approach in the distribution of this vaccine,” Perkins said.
“I am just glad that our team got to play a part.”
Perkins said USAMMC-K Soldiers understood the mission’s importance, with one of them calling it, “a Christmas they would never forget.”
“I could see a sense of pride … across all of their faces,” Perkins added.
“One of them said, ‘we are a part of history.’

U.S. Army COVID-19 Guidance
The antiviral therapies remdesivir, molnupiravir, and the active ingredient in Pfizer’s Paxlovid pill (nirmatrelvir), remain effective in laboratory tests against the BA.2 variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
The BA.2 variant also remains susceptible to at least some of the monoclonal antibodies used to treat COVID-19, such as Evusheld by AstraZeneca.
However, the antibodies etesevimab and bamlanivmab, which are used together as a single treatment, were not able to neutralize the BA.2 virus at common dosages in these lab tests.
Other antibody treatments were less effective against BA.2 than they are against earlier strains of SARS-COV-2.
These results come from new research led by Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a virologist at the UW School of Veterinary Medicine and the University of Tokyo.
The BA.2 omicron variant is related to the more common BA.1 omicron virus, and some evidence suggests that BA.2 can spread more quickly than the already highly contagious BA.1 variant.
“The bottom line is we have antibodies that appear to be more effective against BA. 2 compared with BA.1 or BA.1.1.
That’s good news, but we don’t know whether what we found in in the lab translates into clinical settings,” says Kawaoka, who previously tested how the BA.1 variant responds to treatments.
“We also tested clinically available antiviral compounds, and they are all highly efficacious.”
Kawaoka and his collaborators at UW–Madison and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo published their findings in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 9.
In lab experiments using non-human primate cells, Kawaoka’s team tested seven monoclonal antibodies, three combinations of antibodies, and three antiviral treatments against the BA.2 variant.
Most clinically approved antibody treatments are a combination of multiple antibodies.
The intravenous drug remdesivir and the active ingredients in two anti-COVID-19 pills, Paxlovid and Merck’s molnupiravir, were nearly as effective against BA.1 as they are against the original strain of SARS-CoV-2.
The most effective antibody treatment against the BA.2 variant was Evusheld, which is approved in the U.S. to help prevent COVID-19 infection in people vulnerable to severe disease.
The antibodies sold by Regeneron and GlaxoSmithKline were much more effective against BA.2 than they are against the BA.1 omicron variant, although they were not as potent against BA.2 as they are against earlier versions of the virus.
Available anti-COVID treatments are typically less effective against new variants than they are against the original virus strain, because they were designed and tested against earlier versions of the virus.
Researchers and pharmaceutical companies can design and test treatments against new variants, but that process takes months.

ABOUT CORONAVIRUS 2019 FROM THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
Provided by the
World Health Organization in 2020
The virus originated from Wuhan province in China.
Patients had pneumonia-like symptoms and their common link was the live animal market.
It's shaped like a crown and is the cause of the common cold, SARS-COV 2003, MERS 2012, and SARS COVID 2019.
Transmission is in the form of respiratory droplets.
The average is 5-6 days for transmission to symptoms but can be seen in as little as 1-day or as long as 14.
Symptoms are fever, fatigue, cough, and shortness of breath.
80% of people recuperate; 20% have more adverse reactions based on other health factors such as cancer and diabetes.
Prevention is hand-washing, maintaining social distance and using a mask.
STRUCTURE OF A CORONAVIRUS
The coronavirus particles are organized with long RNA polymers tightly packed into the center of the particle, and surrounded by a protective capsid, which is a lattice of repeated protein molecules referred to as coat or capsid proteins.
In coronavirus, these proteins are called nucleocapsid (N).
The coronavirus core particle is further surrounded by an outer membrane envelope made of lipids (fats) with proteins inserted.
These membranes derive from the cells in which the virus was last assembled but are modified to contain specific viral proteins, including the spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins.
COVID-19 VIRUS UNDER AN ELECTRON MICROSCOPE
Transmission electron microscope image shows SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, isolated form a patient in the U.S. Virus particles are emerging from the surface of cells cultured in the lab.
The spikes on the outer edge of the virus particles give coronaviruses their name, crown-like, NIAID-RML.
HOMEOSTASIS & VIRUSES ARE VIRUSES ALIVE?
The federal government has taken extraordinary measures to help those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, signed into law on March 27, provides funds for federal and state agencies to respond to COVID-19.
It also gives loans and grants to help businesses and hospitals, and tax rebates of up to $1,200 per person.
Additionally, it temporarily expands unemployment benefits.
But while the bulk of spending has not yet reached those in need, there have already been concerns about fraud.
Fraud, waste, abuse, or mismanagement of federal funds erodes the public’s trust in the government, and reduces the support that countless individuals and businesses need right now.
In today’s WatchBlog, we look at some types of fraud, waste, and abuse of federal funds–and how you can report concerns to GAO’s FraudNet.
You can also learn more by listening to our new podcast on COVID-19 and FraudNet.
Fraud, waste, and abuse
When people fraudulently spend, waste, abuse, or mismanage federal funds, it can cost the government millions of dollars.
Fraud can include inflating the number of hours billed to a federal agency for goods or services, under reporting income to receive federal subsidies for food and housing, or selling fake or stolen goods to an agency.
Waste is when someone squanders money or resources, even if it is not illegal.
Waste can include buying overpriced office equipment from a preferred vendor, throwing out a federal agency’s computers rather than donating them to schools, or using federal funds to buy equipment for personal use or gain.
Abuse happens when someone behaves improperly or unreasonably, or misuses their position or authority.
This can include using a federal agency’s computer to download sexually explicit material or writing a contract that favors a specific contractor.
Learn more about fraud, waste, and abuse of federal funds, check out our video on FraudNet below.

Washington – The National Park Service announced today that the Washington Monument will close until further notice as a measure to protect staff and visitors from the spread of COVID-19.
The monument closed on January 11 for security reasons surrounding the 59presidential inauguration.
Today’s public health closure is consistent with local and federal guidance, including the Centers for Disease Control, and was completed in consultation with the National Park Service Office of Public Health, which is led and staffed by commissioned U.S. Public Health Service doctors and public health professionals.
The National Park Service will monitor public health conditions in the Washington, D.C. area, as well as the opening status of other nearby visitor attractions, and reopen the Washington Monument and other indoor park facilities as soon as it deems it is safe to do so.
With the closure of the Washington Monument, all indoor attractions managed as part of National Mall and Memorial Parks, including Belmont-Paul Women’s Equality National Monument, Ford’s Theatre National Historic Site and the tour of the Old Post Office Tower, are now closed as a COVID-19 mitigation measure.
Outdoor memorials on the National Mall remain open, as do public restroom facilities.
For a complete list of closures and changes to operating posture on the National Mall visit https://www.nps.gov/nama/tempclosure.htm A reopening date has not been determined at this time.
Updates will be provided on the National Mall and Memorial Parks website ( nps.gov/NAMA ) as well the park’s Twitter and Facebook pages (@NationalMallNPS).
Recent reports indicate that nearly two-thirds of workers in the United States are on the hunt for a new job or have left the workforce, in large part due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing need for many critical staff, VA has opened numerous positions under a direct-hire authority, which allows agencies to more quickly hire qualified applicants.
It expedites hiring by referring all qualified candidates directly to the hiring manager, without consideration for ranking, rating and other typical selection procedures.
“If you have ever dreamed about having a steady job with good benefits and a retirement plan, now is probably one of the best times in the last decade to secure such positions,” said Darren Sherrard, associate director of recruitment marketing and workforce solutions at VA.
“From housekeeping to police officers, air conditioning mechanics to health technicians, program support assistants and more, there are over 200 job opportunities open to the public now.”
Changing priorities
Research has shown that people tend to reevaluate their jobs after experiencing a major life event.
These events don’t have to be negative; a new baby or the opportunity to pursue new education may certainly spur reevaluation.
However, the universal nature of the pandemic is a major reason so many are considering their options.
“Most people don’t evaluate their job satisfaction every one of 365 days in a year,” said Brooks Holtom, a professor of management and senior associate dean at Georgetown University.
“Those shocks usually happen idiosyncratically for people.
But with the pandemic, it’s happened en masse.”
What workers want
The biggest reason for the job search for many is a better salary.
But after salary, workers cited better benefits and career advancement as the other top motivators.
Jobs at VA provide all that and more.
Competitive starting salaries.
We offer our employees strong starting salaries based on education, training and experience.
We also offer steady growth, with periodic pay raises that address inflation and local market changes.
Education and leadership.
We offer ongoing leadership development through every level of employment, whether it is mandatory programs or competitive opportunities.
All leadership programs align the organization around a set of core competencies that facilitate career development through continuous learning, coaching/mentoring and assessment throughout your career.
Flexible schedules.
Our employees receive 13 to 26 paid vacation/personal days, as well as 13 sick days annually with no limit on accumulation, and we celebrate 11 paid federal holidays each year.
Robust insurance options.
You can choose from a variety of health maintenance organizations or fee-for-service health plans, and all cover preexisting conditions.
Additionally, we pay up to 75% of health premiums, a benefit that can continue into retirement.
Work at VA
Now is the time to join our team by taking advantage of one of these COVID-19 hiring opportunities.

People previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 may produce levels of antibodies against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) after one dose of the Pfizer–BioNTech messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine that are equal to or higher than people not previously infected have after two doses, a new study finds.
Presented virtually March 9 at the Conference for Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI), the results of the small, exploratory study also suggest that the immune responses in most patients previously infected with the pandemic virus did not improve further after a second dose of vaccine.
The study was led by researchers from NYU Grossman School of Medicine, under the auspices of NYU Langone’s Vaccine Center.
The Pfizer vaccine had received an Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on December 12, 2020, based on a clinical trial in which two doses of the vaccine were found to be safe and highly effective in 43,252 participants.
Patients known to be previously infected were excluded from the original trial, as their immune response to the actual infection would have confused the measurement of their response to the vaccine, researchers say.
“Our findings support a hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2–experienced people may require only a single dose of mRNA vaccine,” says Mark J. Mulligan, MD, director of the Division of Infectious Diseases and Immunology and director of the Vaccine Center.
“That said, our results would need to be borne out by larger studies before they influenced current policy, which is that patients receive the evidence-based, two-shot regimen.
Should the final data support it, the goal would be to make more doses available quicker if a subset of patients didn’t need a second shot.”
Between December 14, 2020, and March 7, 2021, more than 90 million doses of the study vaccine were administered, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but just 17.7 percent of the U.S. population had received one or more doses of a vaccine.
Study Details
Vaccines safely mimic actual infections, which teaches the immune system to be ready for a future encounter, researchers say.
The Pfizer vaccine is based on RNA, or ribonucleic acid, which serves as the primary genetic material instead of DNA for the pandemic coronavirus.
The vaccine contains viral mRNA encoding the “spike proteins” used by SARS-CoV-2 to attach to proteins on human cell surfaces, the first step in invading the cells in which it multiplies.
Including the spikes in vaccines has made proteins required for viral ability to infect visible to the human immune system, say the study authors.
Once injected into the arm muscle, the spike protein is made and triggers the production of antibodies, immune proteins that specifically glom onto this viral target protein, disabling it and tagging it for removal from the body.
In the new study, people that previously had COVID-19 infection and who received a single dose of mRNA vaccine produced high levels of “neutralizing” antibodies—those capable of defending cells from the virus and of blocking its biological effects—at 6 to 14 days after the shot that were similar to, or higher than, those in SARS-CoV-2–naive people who had received 2 doses.
Specifically, specimens were collected from 33 participants before and 6 to 14 days after doses 1 and 2.
Thirty-two adults received the Pfizer vaccine, and one the Moderna mRNA vaccine.
Fourteen of 33 had a history of COVID-19 (median age 41, 71 percent female, range of severity), while 19 had not been exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
To compare immune responses after one and two doses of vaccine, the research team used a well-known technology, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which had been tailored in recent months to find the number of useful antibodies in a person’s blood by presenting to it a sample of the spike protein from the COVID-19 virus.
Those antibodies that can attach to the spike do so, while those that cannot are washed away.
The authors also used live-virus microneutralization (MN) against the original SARS-CoV-2 U.S. pandemic strain, a gold standard, high-speed test that indicates whether antibodies created by a vaccine are present and how well antibodies in a sample of blood sera neutralize a virus (for example, the lowest concentration of antibodies to still have an antiviral effect).
Along with Dr. Mulligan, authors of the study from NYU Grossman School of Medicine were Marie Samanovic, Amber Cornelius, Trishala Karmacharya, Jimmy Wilson, Sophie Gray-Gaillard, Joseph Allen, Sara Hyman, and Ramin Herati, of the NYU Infectious Diseases with Public Health Importance (IDPHI) Study Team.
The study was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health.

The Maine Department of Health and Human Services is proposing that the COVID-19 vaccine be removed from the list of required immunizations for health care workers.
The department says the vaccination remains an important tool to protect public health, but that the requirement for health care workers achieved the intended benefit of savings lives, protecting health care capacity and limiting the spread of the virus during the height of the pandemic.
Maine is one of four remaining states with some type of COVID-19 vaccine requirement in place.
“Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Maine has followed the science in developing policies to limit the spread of the virus,” DHHS Commissioner Jeanne Lambrew said in a statement Tuesday.
“Today, a robust body of evolving evidence tells us that this requirement achieved its goals of saving lives and protecting health at a crucial time.
We continue to encourage all Maine people, including dedicated health care workers tending to Maine’s most vulnerable residents, to stay up to date on COVID-19 vaccination.”
The decision was welcomed by hospitals and other health care providers hit by worker shortages during the pandemic.
“This (vaccine) requirement protected our patients, caregivers, and hospital during the height of the pandemic,” said Steven Michaud, president of the Maine Hospital Association.
“We support this science-based update to the rule and will continue to be guided by patient safety in our efforts to limit the spread of the virus and promote vaccination as a valuable tool to protect public health.”

The vaccination requirement for health care workers went into effect on Oct. 20, 2021.
Health care workers upset by the requirement sued the state, arguing that it was their religious right to refuse the vaccine because of their belief that fetal stem cells from abortions are used to develop the vaccines.
The proposed rule change, filed Tuesday with the Department of the Secretary of State, is based on available clinical and epidemiological data about COVID-19, increased population immunity resulting from vaccination and prior infections, decreasing disease severity, improved treatments and declining infection and death rates, DHHS said.
It expects the rule will be published next Wednesday and be adopted by the end of the year following public comment.
The department said it will exercise enforcement discretion regarding COVID-19 vaccination of health care workers during the rulemaking process.
EMS WORKERS SEPARATE
It remains uncertain, however, whether the proposal will be embraced by licensed emergency medical services personnel such as emergency medical technicians and paramedics.
Maine’s Board of Emergency Medical Services, a diverse group of doctors, nurses and paramedics, will consider adoption of the DHHS rule at its Aug. 2 meeting, said J. Sam Hurley, director of Maine’s Emergency Medical Services.
He said the Board of Emergency Medical Services is an authority treated separately from health care employees, who typically work in hospitals or nursing homes.

Hurley said the board could follow DHHS’ recommendation, retain the current policy of requiring emergency medical service responders to be vaccinated, or revise its existing guidelines.
There are more than 1,700 licensed EMS workers in Maine, a number that has remained stable since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hurley said.
“Throughout the pandemic, it has been imperative that our health care system evolve with our response to the pandemic,” Hurley said in a telephone interview Tuesday night.
“As the science changes, we too must evolve with the science.”
Though there were some emergency medical services staffing shortages near the beginning of the pandemic caused by the COVID-19 vaccination requirement – mostly in smaller municipal departments in rural areas of the state – those numbers have since stabilized, Hurley said.
“The system as a whole did not experience a dramatic impact after the pandemic and we should mention that the immunization requirement was proven to have saved lives,” he said.
Maine requires the immunization of employees of health care facility to reduce the risk of exposure to and transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases.
The state defines health care workers as those employed by a hospital, multilevel health care facility, home health agency, nursing facility, residential care facility and intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities.

LAWSUIT TO PROCEED
The law firm representing the workers who sued the state said that it plans to forge ahead with the lawsuit.
In an interview Tuesday night, Horatio Mihet, chief litigation counsel for Liberty Counsel, a law firm based in Orlando, Florida, said the firm continues to represent seven Maine health care workers who lost their jobs because their religious exemptions from Maine’s COVID-19 vaccination mandate were denied.
The suit argues that the plaintiffs have a religious right to refuse the vaccine over their belief that fetal stem cells from abortions were used to develop it.
Plaintiffs also argued that the state mandate was discriminatory by allowing for medical exemptions, but not religious ones.
In a unanimous ruling on May 25, a panel of three judges for the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found U.S. District Judge Jon Levy had not properly weighed the possible public health impact of religious exemptions, which are not allowed by the state’s vaccination policy, and ordered the lower court to review that portion of the case.
“We intend to proceed with the lawsuit,” Mihet said, adding that Liberty Counsel also will seek a judicial decree in U.S. District Court in Maine that seeks to prohibit Mills from permanently enacting a vaccine mandate again.

Mihet said the state’s proposal to remove the vaccine mandate comes on the eve of a status conference Wednesday with the presiding judge to determine if and when the case should go to trial.
Mihet said the DHHS proposal is a step in the right direction, but he is not convinced that Maine has seen the end of government-imposed vaccine mandates for health care workers.
“I have no joy in what the governor has done and we intend to hold her accountable,” Mihet said.
Republicans in the Legislature responded to the proposed rule change, saying that they had argued early on that the mandate would worsen the shortage of health care and EMS workers.
“We appreciate that Maine DHHS has recognized the mandate does not serve any public health interest and begun the rulemaking process to repeal it,” the statement said.
“We urge the administration to expedite the process well before the stated end of 2023.
Republicans hope that some of our health care and EMS heroes who left the profession – and in some cases even the state – can return to serve Maine once again.”
The Maine Health Care Association and Maine Medical Association joined the Maine Hospital Association in supporting the decision to end the vaccine requirement.
“The requirement achieved its intended goals and we fully support this change.
Infections remain low and Maine has some of the highest vaccination rates for long-term care staff and residents.
As the science evolves, we will continue to follow best practices for infection prevention and control and will promote ongoing efforts to educate our community about the many benefits of vaccines,” Angela Westhoff, president and CEO of the Maine Health Care Association, said in a statement.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to recommend everyone ages 6 months and older – including health care workers – remain up to date on the vaccination.
Health care providers remain free to implement COVID-19 vaccination requirements for their employees, DHHS said.
Maine has been rated among the top states on vaccination and was among the lowest for COVID-19 deaths.
Maine currently ranks third overall on bivalent booster vaccination and first for people 65 and older, according to DHHS.

Black Americans stand out from other racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. for their high levels of concern about the coronavirus pandemic, with 81% considering the outbreak a major threat to public health and about half (49%) seeing it as a major threat to their personal health, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in February.
About a third of Black adults (35%) are very concerned that they themselves will get the coronavirus and require hospitalization, and another 29% are at least somewhat concerned about this possibility.
A recent study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that Black life expectancy has fallen 2.7 years from pre-pandemic levels, compared with one year for the overall population – a stark reminder of the virus’s disproportionate impact on Black Americans.
How we did this Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand how Americans are continuing to respond to the coronavirus outbreak.
For this analysis, we surveyed 10,121 U.S. adults, including 911 Black adults, from Feb. 16 to 21, 2021.
Everyone who took part in the survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses.
This way, nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection.
The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories.
Read more about the ATP’s methodology.
Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.
The Center survey finds 78% of Black adults personally know someone who has been hospitalized or who died as a result of having COVID-19.
Black Americans also stand out from other groups for their concern about spreading the disease.
About four-in-ten say they are very concerned about unknowingly spreading the disease to others, and 94% say they have taken the precaution of wearing masks or other face coverings at stores or businesses all or most of the time over the past month.
At least seven-in-ten Black Americans consider a range of restrictions on public activity necessary, including limiting restaurants to carry-out service and closing K-12 schools to in-person learning.
While Black Americans are more concerned about many aspects of the outbreak, a smaller majority (61%) say they will definitely or probably get a COVID-19 vaccine, including 15% who already have, compared with 69% of White adults, 70% of Hispanic adults and 91% of Asian adults.
(The survey was conducted with English-speaking Asian Americans only.)
As with the overall U.S. adult population, older Black adults are more inclined than younger adults to say they have gotten a coronavirus vaccine or that they will.
And among Black adults, men are more inclined than women to get a coronavirus vaccine, a pattern also seen in the general population.
Black adults express less confidence in the coronavirus vaccine research and development process – a judgment closely aligned with intent to get vaccinated.
Among the 34% of Black Americans with low trust in the vaccine R&D process, just 26% say they will get a vaccine or have already done so; 72% say they will not.
In addition to concerns about the vaccine development process, the potential for side effects looms large among those disinclined to get a coronavirus vaccine.
Among the 37% of Black Americans who say they will not get a coronavirus vaccine, 84% cite concern about side effects from the new vaccines as a major reason, while 74% say a major reason is that the vaccines were developed and tested too quickly.
Another 71% of this group cite their desire to know more about how well they work.
Half of Black Americans who do not intend to get a vaccine say a major reason is that they have seen too many mistakes from the medical care system in the past.

Adults aged ≥65 years are at increased risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19 and were identified as a priority group to receive the first COVID-19 vaccines approved for use under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the United States (1–3).
In an evaluation at 24 hospitals in 14 states,* the effectiveness of partial or full vaccination† with Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines against COVID-19–associated hospitalization was assessed among adults aged ≥65 years.
Among 417 hospitalized adults aged ≥65 years (including 187 case-patients and 230 controls), the median age was 73 years, 48% were female, 73% were non-Hispanic White, 17% were non-Hispanic Black, 6% were Hispanic, and 4% lived in a long-term care facility.
Adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19–associated hospitalization among adults aged ≥65 years was estimated to be 94% (95% confidence interval
[CI] = 49%–99%) for full vaccination and 64% (95% CI = 28%–82%) for partial vaccination.
These findings are consistent with efficacy determined from clinical trials in the subgroup of adults aged ≥65 years (4,5).
This multisite U.S. evaluation under real-world conditions suggests that vaccination provided protection against COVID-19–associated hospitalization among adults aged ≥65 years.
Vaccination is a critical tool for reducing severe COVID-19 in groups at high risk.
Randomized clinical trials of vaccines that have received an EUA in the United States showed efficacy of 94%–95% in preventing COVID-19–associated illness (4,5).§ However, hospitalization is a rare outcome among patients with COVID-19–associated illness of any severity, so most cases detected in the trials did not lead to hospitalization; therefore, the studies had limited power to assess protection against severe COVID-19 among older adults.
Postmarketing observational studies are important to assess VE against COVID-19–associated hospitalizations in adults aged ≥65 years under real-world conditions and to strengthen evidence from clinical trials of vaccine efficacy.
A standard approach to postmarketing VE evaluation involves the test-negative design in which vaccine performance is assessed by comparing the odds of antecedent vaccination among case-patients with acute laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and control-patients without acute COVID-19 (6).
During January 1, 2021–March 26, 2021, adults with COVID-19–like illness¶ admitted to 24 hospitals in 14 states within two networks (the Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network [HAIVEN] and the Influenza and Other Viruses in the Acutely Ill [IVY] Network) were enrolled.
Patients were eligible if they were aged ≥65 years on the date of hospital admission, received clinical testing for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or antigen test within 10 days of illness onset, and had onset of symptoms 0–14 days before admission.
Case-patients were those who received one or more positive test results for SARS-CoV-2.
Patients meeting eligibility criteria who received negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results served as controls.
Baseline demographic and health information, details about the current illness, and SARS-CoV-2 testing history were obtained by patient or proxy interviews with trained study personnel and electronic medical record review.
Patients or proxies were asked about SARS-CoV-2 vaccination history including number of doses, dates and location of vaccination, and availability of vaccination record cards documenting receipt.
Secondary electronic medical records and state immunization registry searches for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination records were conducted during March 26, 2021–April 19, 2021, for all included patients without vaccination record cards to verify reported or unknown vaccination status.
Participants were considered to have received COVID-19 vaccine doses based on documentation by CDC vaccination record card, state immunization registry search, electronic medical record search, or by plausible self-report if they provided vaccination dates and location.
Documented record of vaccination dates was used when any potential discordance was identified between self-reported and documented dates.
Participants with unverified COVID-19 testing status or vaccination status, or vaccination with Janssen COVID-19 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson), which was in limited use during the evaluation period, were not included.
SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status included four categories: 1) unvaccinated, defined as no receipt of any SARS CoV-2 vaccine before illness onset; 2) single-dose vaccinated <14 days before illness, defined as receipt of the first vaccine dose <14 days before COVID-19–like illness onset; 3) partially vaccinated, defined as receipt of 1 dose of a 2-dose vaccination series (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines) ≥14 days before illness onset or 2 doses, with the second dose received <14 days before illness onset** (7); and 4) fully vaccinated, defined as receipt of both doses of a 2-dose vaccine series, with the second dose received ≥14 days before illness onset.
Estimates of VE were calculated by comparing the odds of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in case-patients and controls using the equation VE = 100% × (1 − odds ratio), determined from logistic regression models (8).
The 95% CIs were calculated as 1 − CI OR , where CI OR is the confidence interval of the odds ratio estimates.
Models were adjusted a priori for suspected confounders, including U.S. Census region, calendar month, age (as a continuous variable), sex, and race/ethnicity.
Other factors were included in the model if they changed the adjusted odds ratio of vaccination by >5%.
Primary VE estimates were stratified by partial versus full vaccination.
VE for patients reporting illness onset <14 days after receipt of the first dose of a 2-dose vaccine was also assessed.
Because protective immunity is unlikely to be achieved immediately after vaccination (4,5,7), absence of VE within 14 days of the first dose was used as a proxy indicator of absence of bias in the primary VE estimates (6).
Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute).
This activity was reviewed by CDC and the other participating institutions and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.††
During January 1–March 26, 2021, 489 patients were eligible for participation, 72 (15%) of whom were excluded for the following reasons: 30 had SARS-CoV-2 testing >10 days after illness onset, 19 were hospitalized >14 days after illness onset, eight had onset of COVID-19–like illness after admission, three received the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, and 12 had incomplete vaccination verification.
Among the 417 patients included in the final analysis (including 187 case-patients and 230 controls), median age was 73 years for case-patients and controls, 48% were female, 17% were non-Hispanic Black, 6% were Hispanic (any race), 48% had one or more earlier hospitalizations in the last year, and 4% lived in a long-term care facility before admission (Table).
Among the 187 case-patients, 19 (10%) had received at least 1 dose of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine ≥14 days before illness onset (including 18
[10%] who were partially vaccinated and one [0.5%] who was fully vaccinated) compared with 62 (27%) of 230 test-negative controls (including 44 [19%] and
18
[8%] who were partially and fully vaccinated, respectively).
Prevalence of receipt of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines was similar (53% and 47%, respectively, among those vaccinated with ≥1 doses).
Adjusted VE for full vaccination using Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine was 94% (95% CI = 49%–99%), and adjusted VE for partial vaccination was 64% (95% CI = 28%–82%) (Figure).
There was no significant effect for receiving the first dose of a 2-dose COVID-19 vaccine series within 14 days before illness onset (adjusted VE = 3%, 95% CI = −94%–51%).
Since she tested positive for the coronavirus in April 2020, Josie Cabrera Taveras has found herself sleeping for up to 15 hours a day, stopping in grocery store aisles to catch her breath, lapsing in and out of consciousness and unable to return to her job as a nanny.
She believes that she is one of thousands, possibly millions, of Americans who may have a condition known as “long Covid.”
The Biden administration has said people with the condition could qualify for federal disability protections and benefits, which can include health care, housing and unemployment benefits.
But like many others who may have long Covid, Ms. Taveras, 31, has had a hard time proving it.
Two brain M.R.I.s, several heart ultrasounds, dozens of lung X-rays, two stomach endoscopies, one colonoscopy and multiple CT scans have all provided the same results: Everything looks normal.
“It’s something doctors can’t explain yet, what’s happening to me,” Ms. Taveras said.
With no direct medical evidence of her condition, she has been turned down for disability coverage twice.
Even a note from a prestigious post-Covid clinic in the Mount Sinai hospital system, attesting that Ms. Taveras “continues to experience daily symptoms and is currently unable to work,” was not enough.
With the world well into its third year fighting COVID-19, UNICEF has launched a broader push to strengthen health systems around the world to protect against future pandemics.
While systems strengthening has always been integral to UNICEF’s work, the far-reaching impacts of COVID-19 — the millions of lives lost, the economic and social disruptions, a deepening learning crisis for a generation of students — shows the enormity of what's at stake, and has served as a stark reminder of the need to build resilient health systems globally.
Here are five areas UNICEF has identified as priorities to focus on, and why:
1.
Recruit, train and prioritize health care workers
As the heart of any strong health care system, health care workers must be prioritized and supported — professionally, financially and emotionally.
This includes building their confidence, ensuring their thoughts and concerns are understood and working with them to address those issues.
UNICEF works to increase the capacity of health workers by providing training led by UNICEF experts and supporting governments so that they can establish their own training services.
UNICEF also supports psychosocial support efforts to respond to health worker mental health challenges and to promote resilience — recognizing the physical and emotional strain of the past two years.
Jennifer Boateng, Senior Pharmacist at Greater Accra Regional Hospital in Ghana, said working during the pandemic has had a profound impact on her.
"I was still breastfeeding when I started work at the COVID-19 intensive care unit," she recalled.
"I was truly terrified of contracting the virus and putting my family at risk.
Painfully, I had to stop my children from hugging me.”
Boateng has been working to make sure COVID-19 patients get the medication they need.
“Working here has exposed me to the most deaths I have ever witnessed in my career, a haunting journey.
Gathering the courage to come to work each morning takes great effort and mental preparation.”
As UNICEF points out: ensuring adequate support for health workers is important not only to ensure they are equipped to do their jobs, it also helps to make the profession an appealing one that can attract and retain talented and dedicated people.
2. Establish effective surveillance and response systems
During the COVID-19 pandemic, clusters of cases have emerged in different parts of the world at different times.
New, sometimes more transmissible variants have regularly circulated, and they’ve often spread quickly.
With any virus that is constantly moving and changing, it’s important to have effective testing and reporting mechanisms in place to monitor them.
That means that if an outbreak occurs or a new variant emerges, it can be flagged quickly to a central health authority.
By raising the alarm quickly, effective measures can be quickly put in place to help limit virus transmission.
This kind of surveillance works best when it's done at a community level.
Moving forward, larger investments are needed to improve testing, particularly at the community level.
Many low- and middle-income countries still have limited access to and capacity for testing.
Unless and until those capacities are increased, the ability to detect and contain future outbreaks will remain limited.
And that means the possibility of future lockdowns, with schools and businesses closed — and all the social and economic effects that entails.
3.
Build confidence in health services through community health
Trust is crucial to the success of a vaccination campaign — or any public health campaign for that matter.
There must be confidence in health care workers, health institutions and national health agencies, confidence that the guidance they are providing is evidence-based and respected.
And that guidance must be communicated effectively.
People need to know that vaccines are available, where to go to get vaccine doses and when vaccination workers will be administering them.
Communicating this information is particularly crucial in rural communities where temporary clinics often provide these services.
In South Africa, the “Zwakala” vaccine campaign —named after the Zulu term for "come on over," a phrase often used by friends as an invitation— is an example of what can happen when trust is combined with effective messaging.
Through this initiative, community health care workers have been mobilizing in parts of the country where initial COVID-19 vaccination rates have been low.
They’ve been communicating through various mediums, whether it’s on local radio, handing out leaflets or speaking face-to-face with members of their community.
4. Include COVID-19 vaccines in routine immunization packages
To protect communities from COVID-19, vaccines need to be easily accessible at a community level.
To achieve that, COVID-19 vaccines will need to be readily available as part of routine immunization packages — offered to people as part of a regimen of vaccines throughout their lifetime.
This requires expanding and strengthening routine immunization and primary health care services to be able to serve adults, while protecting childhood immunization.
5. Strengthen logistics and supply
The challenges of developing, delivering and administering COVID-19 vaccines to end the pandemic have always been about more than the vaccine doses themselves.
Health care workers need gloves, masks and other protective gear to stay safe on the job.
They need syringes.
They need cold chain equipment to ensure vaccines could be stored at the proper temperature and will not go to waste.
In the Philippines, a country with disaster-prone regions and hundreds of hard-to-reach islands, there were challenges with regard to maintaining cold chain storage in the course of delivering vaccines to remote communities.
In Kabugao, for example, a municipality nestled in the mountains north of Manila, extreme flooding is common and the power often goes out.
To address this challenge, UNICEF and partners has supplied dozens of solar-powered refrigerators to communities like Kabugao.
Moving forward, increased investments in infrastructure of this kind will help to ensure communities can receive — and safely manage — the vaccines they need to protect against future outbreaks.
UNICEF to leverage existing partnerships and global presence to help improve responsiveness of health systems
UNICEF is uniquely placed to work with governments and other partners, the private sector and communities to improve the responsiveness of health systems in low- and middle-income countries and better address a diversity of threats to child survival and development.
UNICEF is calling on partners to seize the opportunity of the moment — not just to end the current pandemic, but to protect against future ones by building stronger health systems in these five critical ways.
While UNICEF continues to support the global pandemic response supporting countries as they roll out COVID-19 tools through their national health systems, key priorities include:
resuming and maintaining essential health care services, including for diagnosis, care,and treatment of respiratory illnesses, with a special focus on “zero-dose communities”
promoting integrated service delivery, including to boost vaccine uptake, testing and care-seeking
engaging communities through multiple platforms for risk communication and community engagement
strengthening community health, data and digital health, supply chains, quality of care, and management capacity to support primary health care
providing infection prevention and control supplies such as soap, hand sanitizer and cleaning materials for primary health care centers
keeping health workers safe through provision of quality personal protective equipment
ensuring that water, sanitation, and waste management infrastructure are in place and operational

UC Davis is “passing the COVID test with flying colors,” MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle said, using a play on words as she concluded a recent interview with Professor Brad Pollock, associate dean for public health sciences, about the university’s COVID-19 testing program.
The saliva testing program started Sept. 14 when students began moving into campus housing for fall quarter, and subsequently expanded to serve the community through Healthy Davis Together.
Earlier this month, the UC Davis Genome Center tested the 100,000th saliva sample.
Here we take a look at what’s behind the test, and how it came together.
The saliva samples go on the plate.
Agricultural genetic technology
IntelliQube high-throughput quantitative PCR machines, using “array-tape” technology, are key to the testing program.
Instead of sample tubes or plates with wells, the machines analyze tape printed with thousands of tiny wells, each of which can carry out a PCR reaction.
Originally developed for use in agricultural genetics, array-tape machines can run thousands of PCR tests a day, far more than machines built specifically for medical diagnostics.
Plant sciences professor Richard Michelmore, director of the Genome Center, and his team developed the testing program and proposed it to the campus.
Funding came through Aug. 4, just over a month before students would arrive.
“This triggered a tremendous mobilization across campus,” Michelmore said.
Saliva samples from testing kiosks.
Spitting in a tube
Taking the test involves the simple matter of spitting in a tube and the results are typically returned within one to two days.
The test is for people who do not have COVID-19 symptoms: Students with symptoms should go to Student Health and Counseling Services, while others should go to their health care providers.
Testing requires making an appointment — in an online process that produces an individualized barcode, which, upon your arrival for testing is matched to a barcode on your sample tube.
Take a sip of water, drip it back into the tube, cap it and you’re done.
The de-identified barcoded tubes are taken to the Genome Center, where the samples are heat-treated to inactivate any virus.
SARS-CoV2 virus particles survive well in saliva, Michelmore noted.
The IntelliQube adds reagents to array tape containing saliva samples.
Tenderized
The samples are then treated with papain protease (aka meat tenderizer) to reduce the viscosity of the saliva and transferred into 384-well plastic plates, then automatically transferred to tape.
The reaction takes about an hour and a half; each IntelliQube can run about 6,000 tests in a 12-hour day.
The results are analyzed with cloud-based UgenTech FastFinder software.
The PCR test is adapted from protocols approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
The laboratory is CLIA-approved as an extension of the UC Davis Student Health Center’s laboratory.
The test can detect as few as 15 copies of the virus in a microliter of saliva, below the threshold of what is likely to be an infectious individual.
Initially, the saliva tests were compared to nasal swabs taken at the same time and processed at a commercial laboratory, but this was discontinued once the accuracy of the saliva test was confirmed.

2 teams of staff
Two separate teams of technical staff, led by DNA Technology Core manager Lutz Froenicke, work to run the tests on different days with a reserve team as backup.
Michelmore credited a “massive effort across campus” with getting the testing program up and running, including Ralph Greene of the UC Davis Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cindy Schorzmann, medical director of Student Health and Counseling Services, and Sheri Belafsky of the UC Davis Medical Surveillance Program — and many, many others who have worked to stand up and run the testing kiosks, acquire machines and equipment, run tests and analyze and report out results.
While Michelmore has received many inquiries from other universities and businesses, he noted they are not currently planning to expand testing beyond UC Davis, Davis, other locations in Yolo County, and UC Merced due to finite capacity.
However, he noted that none of the protocols and workflows are patented and could be replicated by others.

A deadly second wave of coronavirus infections is devastating India, leaving millions of people infected and putting stress on the country’s already overtaxed health care system.
Officially, by late May, about 27 million infections had been confirmed and more than 300,000 people were dead, but experts said the actual figures were most likely much higher.
At one point, India had been responsible for more than half of the world’s daily Covid-19 cases and set a record-breaking pace of about 400,000 a day.
The official numbers show signs of easing.
The major cities of Delhi and Mumbai, hit hard at the beginning of the second wave, have reported sharp drops in new infections and deaths.
On May 31, Delhi lifted restrictions on manufacturing and construction, critical drivers of an economy that has been battered by the pandemic.
But life in the capital city is not expected to return to normal immediately.
Schools and most businesses are still closed.
Still, the virus is likely spreading through the rest of the country, and only a tiny portion of the population has been fully vaccinated.
SEATTLE — U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seized 360 pills Wednesday of unauthorized influenza treatments being marketed to treat COVID-19.
CBP officers in Seattle seized a shipment of
unauthorized COVID-19 medication on Wednesday.
In addition to their role as enforcers of Customs and Immigration regulations, CBP officers and agriculture specialists actively enforce more than 400 laws and regulations for 40 government agencies.
This includes enforcing U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) statues, such as preventing unauthorized medical treatments that may mislead consumers by falsely claiming to treat or prevent diseases or may in fact harm the consumer.
The use of unauthorized medications can give consumers a false sense of security and could prove fatal.
Unauthorized products that claim to cure, treat or prevent serious illnesses such as COVID-19 may cause individuals to delay or stop appropriate medical treatment, leading to serious harm.
Stopping the flow of harmful products is a priority trade issue for CBP.
The importation of harmful products can damage the U.S. economy and threaten the health and safety of the American people.
CBP, both with this seizure and on a daily basis, works with FDA to protect U.S. consumers from fake and harmful medications.
This partnership extends beyond excluding prohibited items into ensuring timely screening of compliant items and active communication to address importer questions and concerns.
“We show vigilance in carrying out our mission to protect the American public, whether it be terrorist weapons or dangerous medications,” Seattle Area Port Director Clay Thomas said.
“The men and women of CBP value our enforcement partnerships and are proud to work with the dedicated FDA team to further protect the public.”
U.S. Customs and Border Protection has direct responsibility for enhancing U.S. economic competitiveness.
By reducing costs for industry and enforcing trade laws against counterfeit, unsafe, and fraudulently entered goods, CBP is working to enable legitimate trade, contribute to American economic prosperity, and protect against risks to public health and safety.
This Chalkboard post from May 2020 draws on historical data and past research to forecast the possible impact of COVID-19 school closures on student achievement.
With actual data from the 2020-21 school year now available, please see this December 2020 Chalkboard post for an updated analysis of this trend.
Answering this question is complicated by the unique circumstances of COVID-19.
Current school closures have added to the time that most students already spend at home during the summer months without explicit face-to-face instruction from teachers.
Meanwhile, teachers are scrambling to adapt content for an online platform and parents are juggling work responsibilities (if not joblessness) with caring for and educating their own children.
Students themselves are faced with isolation, anxiety about a deadly virus, and uncertainty about the future.
In so many ways, the current situation is unprecedented for most people alive today.
Virtually all K-12 students in the United States are currently missing face-to-face instruction due to COVID-19.
Many parents and educators thus share a common worry: When the pandemic subsides, kids will return to school with lower achievement.
There are also concerns that the gap between high- and low-achieving students will become larger.
Given the need to address these concerns, we decided to use prior test scores from millions of students and leverage research on summer learning patterns to make informed projections of what learning loss due to the pandemic might look like.
Ultimately, we wanted to know: What sort of learning losses could we expect from the shortened 2019-20 school year?
Yet there are parallels between the current situation and other reasons students miss school that can give us insight into how COVID-19 may affect achievement.
This includes research on the effects of out-of-school time on learning due to absenteeism, weather-related school closures (e.g., Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans), and summer vacation.
Existing evidence can provide a rough sense of how time out of school due to COVID-19 will affect achievement.
We relied heavily on past precedent when trying to understand how COVID-19 might impact achievement in the short and medium term.
We used a national sample of over 5 million students in grades 3-8 who took MAP Growth assessments in 2017-2018.
These assessments enable such estimates because MAP Growth is administered multiple times per year, which means test scores are available in fall, winter, and spring such that changes in achievement during the year can be understood and anticipated.
We compared typical growth for students who completed a standard-length school year to projections under multiple scenarios.
These scenarios were directly informed by out-of-school-time research.
The results are deeply concerning.
The two figures below show projected math and reading learning patterns from the beginning of the 2019-20 school year (before COVID-19 school closures) through the start of the 2020-21 school year.
The solid lines represent average trajectories in a typical year with typical growth (estimated based on a prior year’s data) followed by normal patterns of learning loss over the summer (generally, student achievement/learning tends to decline during the summer, though this varies greatly by student).
Next, we assume an extended summer loss would occur during the period since schools closed.
We refer to this scenario as the “COVID Slide” (represented by the dotted lines).
These projections give a sense of how much learning students could lose, though we hope they will be overestimations of loss, given the online instruction and home schooling occurring.
These preliminary COVID Slide estimates suggest students could begin fall 2020 with roughly 70% of the learning gains in reading from the prior year relative to a typical school year.
In mathematics, students may show even smaller learning gains from the previous year, returning with less than 50% of the gains.
In lower grades, students may be nearly a full year behind in math compared to what we would observe in normal conditions.
Though not shown in the figures, we produced similar estimates of learning loss based on research showing the effect of being absent on achievement.
That is, we simply assumed students’ learning during COVID-19 school closures would be akin to what occurs when students miss school, a large assumption given the online learning and homeschooling now occurring.
Results for absenteeism-based projections were often more dire.
We also examined how much more variable achievement might be in the fall—that is, how wide the range in achievement might be between very high and very low-performing students.
This range has implications for whether teachers can provide similar content to all students in their classrooms, or if they might need to further differentiate instruction based on a broader range of needs.
The above figures show our estimate of that variability by subject for 4th and 6th grade.
The shaded areas display the spread in potential outcomes between students who were in the 25th percentile of summer learning loss (who showed steep declines) and those in the 75th percentile (who showed flat lines or even small gains during the summer).
In mathematics, we see a fair amount of variability in learning rates, though the majority of students show losses over the extended closure and summer period.
However, in reading, there is an even wider spread of potential outcomes, with students who are in the 75th percentile and above showing sizable learning gains during the summer.
Further, the figure below shows that extended time out of school may lead to more variability in achievement when students return in the fall relative to a typical year.
A wider range of learning needs like the ones suggested by the figure could create greater challenges for teachers.
The New York Times warns that today’s students could be the “COVID generation.”
As we think through our road to recovery, we hope education leaders consider our projections among many data points when preparing to support students returning in the fall.
Specifically, our results indicate that:
(Washington, DC) – Today, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced the District’s COVID-19 Action Plan, including the declaration of a public emergency; the expansion of testing, including new Test Yourself DC sites, the launch of the new Test Yourself Express Program, and the use of rapid tests for students and staff as they return from winter break; reinstating of the indoor mask mandate; implementation of a DC government vaccine mandate to include boosters; and the creation of COVID-19 Testing and Vaccination sites.
Expanded Testing
DC Health is expanding the availability of PCR tests.
In addition, to the eight firehouse testing sites and the existing 27 Test Yourself DC pick-up and drop-off sites, the District is adding nine new sites to pick up and drop off at-home PCR tests – for a total of 36 sites.
DC Health has also ordered 1,050,000 rapid antigen tests — 150,000 BinaxNOW and 900,000 iHealth Antigen tests.
Of those tests, 42,000 are currently on-hand and 200,000 Antigen tests are in transit to Washington, DC.
The Test Yourself Express program will provide residents with free at-home rapid Antigen COVID-19 tests.
Beginning Wednesday, December 22, the rapid antigen COVID-19 tests will be available at eight District libraries, six days a week.
District residents will be able to access a maximum of two kits per day, and proof of DC residency will be required, (e.g., a DC ID or a piece of mail with a DC address) to get a test.
After using a rapid at-home test, residents should report their results to DC Health at coronavirus.dc.gov/overthecounter.
The following locations will be Test Yourself Express sites beginning Wednesday, December 22:
Indoor Mask Mandate
The Mayor also announced that beginning Tuesday, December 21 at 6 am, the indoor mask mandate will be reinstated until January 31, 2022 at 6 am.
DC Government Vaccine Mandate
A new vaccine mandate has also been put in place, where all employees, contractors, interns, and grantees of DC Government must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and must have a booster.
There will be no test-out option.
DC Government will engage labor partners on a specific deadline.
COVID-19 Testing and Vaccination Centers
COVID-19 Testing and Vaccination Centers will also give residents more certainty in where and when to find testing and vaccines, and allow DC Health to flex hours as needed.
The announced plan is for the Testing and Vaccination Centers to begin to come online in the second half of January with the goal of one center per ward.
The District is also calling on property owners with potential sites to work with the DC Government to use those sites as Testing and Vaccination centers.
Property owners interested in participating can reach out to DC Government at retailspace.dc.gov.
DCPS Winter Break Return
The Mayor and Chancellor also announced that DC Public Schools will be closed for instruction on Monday, January 3 and Tuesday, January 4.
Staff and families will use those days to pick-up rapid antigen tests.

Do Your Part: Get Vaccinated and Boosted
Mayor Bowser reminds every resident five and older to get vaccinated, if they haven’t done so already.
Anyone 16 or older who has received their second dose of Pfizer or Moderna on or before June 20, 2021, or who has received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine on or before October 20, 2021 is encouraged to get a booster dose as soon as possible.
In addition, all District residents six months and older should get vaccinated with the flu vaccine to protect themselves and the health care system.
Residents can get a COVID-19 vaccination in the District by doing the following:

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will extend its partnership with national pharmacy and grocery retail chains CVS, Rite-Aid, Walgreens, Quest (through services at Walmart) and eTrueNorth (through services at Kroger, Health Mart, and Walmart) so they may continue to seamlessly provide Americans convenient access to COVID-19 testing.
The partnership, which is part of the Community-Based Testing Program, has scaled up to more than 600 COVID-19 testing sites in 48 states and the District of Columbia.
Approximately 70% of these testing sites are located in communities with moderate-to-high social vulnerability, as evidenced by their racial, and ethnic composition, and their housing, economic, language barrier, and similar considerations.
“The Trump Administration will continue to fully support the public health needs of all states as they respond to recent increases in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.
To maintain or increase our COVID-19 testing footprint, especially in areas of high social vulnerability, we are extending this partnership through August 2020.
To date, this single program has tested over 750,000 individuals,” said Assistant Secretary for Health ADM Brett P. Giroir, M.D.
“We need to leverage the power of the private sector to provide easy access and availability of testing to help slow community spread of COVID-19.”
The contract utilizes a federal bundled payment program paid directly to retailers that receive a flat fee for each test administered, with participating retailers responsible for coordinating the full end-to-end testing.
That process includes online and telephone registration and appointment scheduling, provider order and notification of result, on-site personnel and security, medical supplies and equipment, and lab testing (on-site or commercial lab) capabilities.
Partners are also required to adhere to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention testing criteria.
“This program not only provides convenient access to COVID-19 testing, it is a bridge for retailers to implement new regulatory flexibilities and expanded reimbursement options HHS has provided through private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, and the newly expanded authority given to pharmacists to order and administer COVID-19 testing,” said Deputy Surgeon General RADM Erica Schwartz, M.D., M.P.H., who oversees the program.
“Providing retailers an option for reimbursement for COVID-19 testing outside of this contract will be essential for the private sector to take over COVID-19 testing once this contract concludes.
CVS has set up 1,400 additional testing sites using these regulatory flexibilities.”
The accessibility and distribution of retail and community-based pharmacies make pharmacy and retail sites the first point of contact with a healthcare professional for many Americans.

V. Dec 3, 2020 Dashboard: Preparedness for the reception of COVID-19 vaccines for the Americas
• Women around the world are losing paid work and doing more unpaid work as a result of the pandemic.
• Female entrepreneurs now need support, because much rebuilding will fall on them.
• Full economy parity was 257 years away, even before the crisis.
This week I spoke at an event that was both bleak and inspiring in equal measure.
I was speaking alongside the World Bank, Dutch Development Bank and other experts on the disproportionate impact that COVID-19 is having on women entrepreneurs.
It was bleak, because the outlook for women in the face of this pandemic is devastating.
But inspiring, because I felt a collective desire to tackle the problem head-on.
Let me be clear: the longer-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will not be equal for women and men.
We are currently experiencing the biggest setback in gender equality for a generation.
It’s not just humanitarian and development agencies like CARE who are saying this – my co-panellists from the banks also had hard evidence to support it; for example, the World Bank has seen more female businesses closing during this pandemic than men’s.
This pandemic is having a deep impact on women and is throwing away decades of hard-won battles both in terms of gender equality and women’s economic rights.
COVID-19 has seen the burden of unpaid work on women significantly increase around the globe.
There has also been a sharp rise in gender-based violence as a result of the worldwide lockdown.
Women are also more likely to be in informal and low-paid jobs, and millions have lost their livelihoods overnight.
In Latin America alone, there are around 19 million domestic workers, 80% without contracts, who have been laid off with very little legal and social protection.
For women entrepreneurs from our programmes, the picture is as stark.
In Sri Lanka, 90% say their income has decreased and their supply chains are disrupted.
In Guatemala, 96% do not have enough money to buy basic food items, and the same amount say the crisis has increased unemployment in their community.
Many of these women are now truly on a cliff edge, at risk of hurtling right back into poverty.
A devastating prospect after they've worked so hard to succeed.
The burden of care falls disproportionately on women.

Before this crisis, the World Economic Forum predicted it would take 257 years to reach economic parity between women and men – this was already scandalous.
It is both devastating and frustrating that this figure has been set back by generations more.
Women entrepreneurs have overcome so many barriers to get their businesses thriving and to overcome poverty.
And it is precisely these women that hold the power to face the gigantic task ahead.
We’ve seen it with the Ebola crisis, with women from war-torn countries, and we know we will see it after this pandemic.
Women can and will elevate their communities back out of poverty, rebuilding what they have lost, and they urgently need our support and help.
Having worked in this sector for 25 years, I remain in awe of the strength and resilience of women – even those in the most dire circumstances who are struggling to feed their families every day.
Hearing Dorcas, an entrepreneur from Sierra Leone, speak during the Women Mean Business event once again reinforced that strength.
She has had to close her restaurant business and training school as a result of COVID-19, but she is already diversifying and is clear on what is needed.
In Dorcas’s own words: “Women need training and financial support so that they can build up their businesses, and support their families and their communities.”
Women hold this power to get their communities back on track.
That’s why I am calling on decision-makers to double their support for women-led micro and small enterprises as an explicit part of international COVID-19 responses.

New ACS Report Finds Smoking Rates, Alcohol Use, Physical Inactivity Decreased During COVID-19; Worsening Trends in Obesity, Cervical Cancer Screening
Latest American Cancer Society Prevention and Early Detection study also shows disparities persisted during pandemic
ATLANTA, May 2, 2023 –
In a new report, American Cancer Society (ACS) researchers discovered both favorable and unfavorable changes in major cancer risk factors, preventive behaviors and services, and screenings in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Between 2019 and 2021, current smoking, physical inactivity, and heavy alcohol consumption declined, and human papillomavirus vaccination and stool testing for colorectal cancer screening uptake increased.
In contrast, obesity prevalence increased, while cervical cancer screening declined during the same timeframe.
Additionally, disparities by racial/ethnic and socioeconomic status persisted.
The findings were published today in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, as well as in the biennial ACS report Cancer Prevention and Early Detection Facts & Figures, 2023-2024.
The review is one of the only sources that looks at major modifiable cancer risk factors, HPV and HepB vaccinations, and cancer screening test use.
“These latest findings give us a mixed bag concerning progress in the fight to help reduce the cancer burden in adults in the U.S.,” said Dr. Priti Bandi, scientific director, cancer risk factors & screening surveillance research at the American Cancer Society and co-author of the study.
“As more years of data are collected, it will be clearer whether these contrasting changes are transient or not.”
For the study, ACS researchers analyzed data from the National Health Interview Survey, the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System, and the National Immunization Survey to study changes in major modifiable cancer risk factors, preventative behaviors, and screenings during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2019-2021.
Forty-five percent of the 609,820 cancer deaths to occur in the U.S. in 2023 are expected to be attributable to modifiable cancer risk factors, such as cigarette smoking, excess body weight, alcohol intake, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, and obesity, and potentially, all avoidable through lifestyle changes.
Cancer screening tests can further prevent thousands of additional cancer cases and deaths.
Findings showed Improvements in select cancer risk factors and screenings:
Cigarette smoking prevalence in adults declined from 14% in 2019 to 12% in 2021, an estimated 5.7 million decline in the number of adults who currently smoke.
By state, smoking prevalence between 2019 and 2021 declined in 17 of 50 states and the District of Columbia.
Physical inactivity prevalence among adults declined from 26% in 2019 to 23% in 2021, or an estimated 3.2 million fewer persons reporting physical inactivity.
Heavy alcohol consumption prevalence among adults declined from 7% in 2019 to 6% in 2021, or an estimated 1.4 million fewer persons reporting heavy drinking.
Prevalence of home-based stool testing for colorectal cancer increased from 7% in 2019 to 10% in 2021, which translated to an estimated additional 3.6 million persons.
There were also unfavorable trends reported:
The median obesity prevalence across U.S. states increased from 32% to 34%.
Obesity prevalence in adults increased in 18 of the 50 states and remained unchanged in the remaining states.
Recommended fruit consumption in adults declined from 30% in 2019 to 29% in 2021, which translated to an estimated decline of 4.5 million adults reporting recommended fruit consumption.
Up-to-date cervical cancer screening declined amongst eligible women from 75% in 2019 to 73% in 2021.
Yet, disparities by racial/ethnic and socioeconomic status persisted:
Persons with less than a high school education did not experience any changes in smoking prevalence or quit ratio between 2019-2021, further entrenching persistent socioeconomic disparities in smoking.
Lower educated persons (<HS, HS/GED educated) are between 4 to 5 times more likely to smoke than college-educated persons in 2021.
Uninsured persons are between 28% to 60% less likely to be up to date with recommended cancer screenings compared to privately insured persons in 2021, with the largest disparity for colorectal cancer and breast cancer screenings.
This access disparity persisted at similar levels since 2019.
“Ongoing efforts to reduce modifiable risk factors and improve receipt of screening are warranted,” said Dr. Ahmedin Jemal, senior vice president, surveillance and health equity science at the American Cancer Society and senior author of the study.
“We also must target our interventions among individuals of racially/ethnically diverse groups and socioeconomic position who continue to be greatly affected by cancer.”
“The pandemic put a spotlight on the criticality of maintaining health and access to free preventive services, including cancer screening, HPV vaccination, and tobacco cessation is more important than ever,” said Lisa A. Lacasse, president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, ACS’s advocacy affiliate.
“We urge lawmakers at all levels of government to protect and advance policies that prioritize cancer prevention.”
Jessica Star is lead author of the report.
Other ACS researchers contributing to the study include: Dr. Farhad Islami, Dr. Nigar Nargis, Dr. Robin Yabroff, Adair Minihan, and Dr. Robert Smith.

In the present study, the prevalence of patients experiencing abdominal pain during COVID-19 was higher than in the reported literature (23.7 versus 14.5%)8.
This may be explained by the fact that abdominal pain was broadly captured manually from medical records from COVID-19 symptoms onset and also throughout the entire hospital course.
This strategy was adopted because the time course of this symptom remains unclear.
Contrary to other studies, both history and physical examination was considered.
Although this strategy may overestimate abdominal pain, particular care was taken to eliminate patients with abdominal pain from other evident etiologies (eg. coprostasis, gallbladder disease, etc.) and adjusted our analysis for abdominal surgery.
As a quality control of the recording process, we calculated that median time between pain symptoms and SARS-CoV2 infection diagnosis was of 0 (interquartile range 7) days, indicating that a majority of abdominal pain were captured early during SARS-CoV2 infection.
In this work we unveiled the patterns of COVID-19-related abdominal pain which was never done before, to the best of our knowledge.
Patients demonstrated the highest frequency of spontaneous or elicited pain in the upper abdomen with predominance of the epigastric and right upper regions.
However, 17.1% of patient had a history of right lower region and 21.7% abdominal point tenderness in left lower region.
We hypothesized that these two features could be the hallmark of a manifestation of COVID-19 that could involve small gut and/or colon instead of the liver.
Unfortunately, as we did not collected data about transit, we do not know if this pattern of abdominal pain was preferentially associated with diarrheas, nausea or vomiting.
Using these pain patterns in our analysis, we then demonstrated an association between Murphy’s sign and right upper region tenderness and severe COVID-19 outcomes.
Adjustment was based on supposed confusion factors but did not dramatically change the strength or the significance of the association.
This primary analysis was limited by the possibility to adjust for BMI and alcohol consumption due to missing data and possible other unknown confounding factors.
Therefore, we performed a secondary analysis as a sensibility analysis of the addition of BMI and alcohol consumption in the model (Table S1).
In this secondary analysis, the associations mentioned earlier did not change.
However, epigastric point tenderness which presented an inverse association with the composite outcome and was not statistically significant anymore after adjustment in the primary analysis, was again statistically significant with our secondary analysis.
The p value of this association in this secondary analysis was close to 0.05 and this finding could be a type I error.
Moreover, biliary tract or liver pain can both be felt in right hypochondria and epigastric region but tenderness is more precisely localized in right upper region after percussion, palpation or Murphy’s sign testing.
Indeed, localized epigastric tenderness in COVID-19 might be related to gastritis and not to an injury to the liver or biliary tract.
Of note, history of abdominal pain or tenderness in other regions of the abdomen and diffuse pain were not associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes.
Association between 5× the upper level of transaminases (250 UI) and abdominal pain was first studied using a two-way table at different time points (baseline transaminases, maximal value during the first 7 days or maximal value during the first 30 days after admission) (data not shown).
This analysis only showed an association with the maximal value of transaminases during the first 30 days.
As many factors can raise LFT during hospital course (for which we could not adjust), we decided to only consider the baseline value of transaminases and to run a logistic regression to adjust for confounding factors.
Thus, we demonstrated different associations with AST and ALT and history of upper region pain but not with any pattern of abdominal point tenderness excepting Murphy’s sign.
Indeed, it has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV2 induced both an alternation of hepatic blood flow, as a systemic response to the infection, with sinusoid thrombi and a direct replication of virus in liver tissue6.
These two features could indicate two distinct physio-pathological processes (a systemic reaction with activation of coagulation and a direct insult to the liver).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, which allow the entry of the SARS-CoV2 in cells, are prominent in liver tissue, particularly on bile duct cells9 but the virus can replicate in both hepatocytes10,11 and bile duct cells12.
This could partially explain the elevation of LFT observed during COVID-19 while cytolytic pattern of injury is most frequent than cholestasic13.
Elevation of LFT is multifactorial in COVID-196 and in the present study, we stay focused on baseline LFT using stringent cut-off of 5× the upper level of transaminases (the hallmark of viral hepatitis14) to decrease the probability of considering drug-induced cytolysis.
On the other hand, we excluded patients with COVID-19-induced mild elevation of transaminases which has been frequently reported1.
However, while some authors suggest a distinction between COVID-19-induced hepatitis and mild cytolysis, our analysis did not demonstrate a multimodal but an unimodal and left-skewed distribution of transaminases, an observation already reported15.
While physiopathology of SARS-CoV2 infection on liver tissue has been investigated, little is known about the effects of the virus on the gut and its role on abdominal pain 2.
The virus could directly replicate in epithelial and glandular cells at various localizations along the intestinal tract16,17 and it is supposed that gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19, including abdominal pain are induced by gut viral infection1.
However, abdominal pain during COVID-19 might also be induced by hepatitis or an inflammation of biliary tract and we previously detected the presence of SARS-CoV2 RNA in gallbladder tissue from a patient with acalculous cholecystitis5.
In the present study, the majority of patients described pain in upper abdominal regions, but a significant proportion also had a pain pattern localized in the lower abdomen.
This could indicate that abdominal pain during COVID-19 is either induced by liver injury or gut infection.
In order to assess the hypothesis that COVID-19 induces two different manifestations on gastrointestinal system with opposite outcomes, we finally compared the localization of abdominal pain and the presence of dyspnea in a post hoc analysis.
Using paired analysis, we showed that dyspnea was more prominent in patients with pain in the upper abdomen.
According to our findings we built the hypothesis that two forms of COVID-19 may exist and could be characterized by different gastrointestinal manifestations and different outcomes (Fig. 3).
The first form or liver-COVID-19 could be identified by elevated transaminases, abdominal pain localized preferentially in right upper region, dyspnea and a higher probability to be admitted to IMCU, ICU or to die during the hospitalization.
The second form or gut-COVID-19 could be hallmarked by gastric and lower hemi-abdomen pain and could be associated with less severe outcomes regarding IMCU, ICU admission or death and less dyspnea.
Figure 3 Proposed hypothesis of two forms of COVID-19 gastrointestinal symptoms: the liver and the gut COVID-19.
Liver COVID-19 could be associated with upper abdomen pain and, dyspnea and more severe clinical outcomes while gut COVID-19 with lower abdomen pain and less severe outcomes.

The present work was limited by its retrospective design and the number of missing data for some variables.
Data were missing due to a lack of accuracy of medical records but also because of research method limitations.
These missing data had considerable consequences and we were not able to analyze other LFT such as alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin and γ-glutamyltransferase.
Moreover, gastrointestinal symptoms are not limited to abdominal pain.
Anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting as well as gastrointestinal bleeding have been frequently identified during COVID-191.
We deliberately choose not to look for them in order to reduce the number of variables we were manually looking for.
Indeed, as the study was concentrating on abdominal pain and liver injury, we did not expect during protocol preparation that other gastrointestinal symptoms were of interest.
Gut-COVID-19 might be associated with other gastrointestinal symptoms.
Collecting observational studies in a meta-analysis, Mao et al. demonstrated that only patients with abdominal pain had severe form of COVID-19 whereas other gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting or nausea were not associated with severe outcomes3.
Moreover, the frequent utilization of antibiotic and antiviral therapy (Hydroxychloroquine, ritonavir) could be a cause of gastrointestinal symptoms and a potential cofounding factor for this study as patient with severe COVID-19 could have been preferentially selected for experimental therapies18.
However, experimental treatments were introduced in our hospital, only in severe COVID-19 patients, most of whom were already intubated in the ICU, making unlikely the report of abdominal pain.
Also, other causes of abdominal pain could have falsely suggested an associated with COVID-19 such as diaphragmatic irritation or enteral nutrition, but we estimated that their effect is limited.
Considering that pain in left upper region was rarely reported both during history and physical examination (respectively 5.5% and 6.6% cf.
Fig. 2) it is unlikely that COVID-19 pneumopathy have induced exclusively right-sided extra-digestive abdominal pain, sparing left side.
The effect of enteral nutrition was also negligible, as abdominal pain appeared early in the disease course (as reported earlier) and enteral nutrition was mainly limited to ICU patients with invasive mechanical ventilation unable to precisely report pain.
Thus, this project deserves further studies with prospective design to verify our findings and hypotheses.
In a matter of weeks, the lives of so many have changed in ways they had never imagined.
People can no longer meet, work, eat, shop, and socialize as they used to.
The working world moved rapidly from business as usual to cautious travel, office closures, and work-from-home mandates.
Instead of traveling and going out to eat at restaurants, consumers across the world are tightening their purse strings to spend only on essentials—primarily food, medicine, and home supplies—and getting these delivered much more often.
Physical distancing has directly changed the way people inhabit and interact with physical space, and the knock-on effects of the virus outbreak have made the demand for many types of space go down, perhaps for the first time in modern memory.
This has created an unprecedented crisis for the real estate industry.
Beyond the immediate challenge, the longer this crisis persists, the more likely we are to see transformative and lasting changes in behavior.
To respond to the current and urgent threat of COVID-19, and to lay the groundwork to deal with what may be permanent changes for the industry after the crisis, real estate leaders must take action now.
Many will centralize cash management to focus on efficiency and change how they make portfolio and capital expenditure decisions.
Some players will feel an even greater sense of urgency than before to digitize and provide a better—and more distinctive—tenant and customer experience.
And, as the crisis affects commercial tenants’ ability to make lease payments, many operators will need to make thousands of decisions for specific situations rather than making just a few, broad-based portfolio-wide decisions.
Most real estate players have been smart to begin with decisions that protect the safety and health of all employees, tenants, and other end users of space.
The smartest will now also think about how the real estate landscape may be permanently changed in the future, and will alter their strategy.
Those that succeed in strengthening their position through this crisis will go beyond just adapting: they will have taken bold actions that deepen relationships with their employees, investors, end users, and other stakeholders.
The immediate challenge
Over the past several years, real estate investments have generated steady cash flow and returns significantly above traditional sources of yield—such as corporate debt—with only slightly more risk.
Since the virus outbreak, however, this reality has changed, and real estate players have been hit hard across the value chain.
Service providers are struggling to mitigate health risks for their employees and customers.
Many developers can’t obtain permits and they face construction delays, stoppages, and potentially shrinking rates of return.
Meanwhile, many asset owners and operators face drastically reduced operating income, and almost all are nervous about how many tenants will struggle to make their lease payments.
“Concession” and “abatement” are the words of the day, and players are working rapidly to figure out for whom they apply and how much.
Not all real estate assets are performing the same way during the crisis.
The market seems to have pivoted mostly on the inherent degree of physical proximity among an asset class’s users—even more so than on its lease length.
Assets that have greater human density seem to have been the hardest hit: healthcare facilities, regional malls, lodging, and student housing have sold off considerably.
By contrast, self-storage facilities, industrial facilities, and data centers have faced less-significant declines.
As of April 3, by one estimate, the unlevered enterprise value of real estate assets had fallen 25 percent or more in most sectors and as much as 37 percent for lodging (the most extreme example).
It’s no surprise that—when shoppers avoid crowds, universities send students home, and retailers, restaurants, and hotels close their doors—owning and operating those properties is a less valuable proposition.
As such, liquidity and balance-sheet resilience have become paramount.
Behavioral changes that may outlive the crisis
Real estate owners and operators across almost every asset class are considering several potential longer-term effects of the coronavirus outbreak and the required changes that these shifts are likely to bring.
For example, within commercial office space, the multiyear trend toward densification and open-plan layouts may reverse sharply.
Public-health officials may increasingly amend building codes to limit the risk of future pandemics, potentially affecting standards for HVAC, square footage per person, and amount of enclosed space.
At the same time, just as baby boomers age into the sweet spot for independent and assisted living, fear of viral outbreaks like COVID-19 may prompt them to stay in their current homes longer.
It is possible that demand for senior living assets could dampen, or the product could change altogether to meet new preferences for more physical space and more-intensive operational requirements.
It is also possible that senior-living facilities could prove they are best able to handle viral outbreaks, accelerating demand.
The COVID-19 experience could also permanently change habits that may affect demand for other real estate assets, such as hospitality properties and short-term leases.
Even a short moratorium on business travel could have lasting impact when alternatives such as video conferences prove sufficient or even preferrable.
Near-shoring of supply chains may further reduce demand for cross-border business travel, and consumers who are afraid of traveling overseas may shift leisure travel to local destinations.
Consumers forced to shop online because of closed malls and shopping centers may permanently adjust their buying habits for certain categories toward e-commerce.
Before the pandemic, consumers were already shifting their spending away from physical stores.
This long-term trend may accelerate even faster after the crisis—especially as many previously struggling brands are tipped over the edge into bankruptcy or forced to radically reduce their footprint.
Early evidence from China shows some staying power in the coronavirus-driven shift to e-commerce.
Within certain product categories where supermarkets or mainstream retailers competed with online retailers, substantial market share could transfer to online players.
The shift to e-commerce may also further boost already high demands for industrial space.
Relatively niche asset classes (such as self-storage and cloud kitchens) could see an improvement in their unit economics, as demand density goes up when more people work from home, while other asset classes (such as coliving) may suffer.
And universities forced to educate remotely for entire semesters could convince students and other stakeholders that existing tools are sufficient to provide a high-quality education at a lower cost, and a new type of hybrid (online–offline) education could become even more widely embraced.
The depth and breadth of economic impact on the real estate sector is uncertain, just as the scale of human catastrophe from the pandemic is yet to be seen.
However, behavioral changes that will lead to significant space becoming obsolete in a post-coronavirus environment seem imminent.
Given the potential for transformative changes, real estate players will be well served to take immediate action to improve their businesses but also keep one eye on a future that could be meaningfully different.
How leading real estate owners and operators are navigating the crisis
While the longer-term consequences are difficult to predict, the immediate market consequences of the coronavirus crisis have been made clear—the public market sell-off in certain real estate types has been nothing short of dramatic.
All companies, public and private, are working hard to navigate the immediate crisis with respect to staff, tenants, and end users of space, while also facing tough business trade-offs.
Most industry leaders seek to strike the right balance between capital preservation and further strengthening their competitive differentiation.
Over the past several years, industry leaders have been diversifying sources of revenue, pursuing digital strategies, and focusing on tenant experience.
The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the need for those strategic changes—and highlighted that those that haven’t yet made such investments will probably need to catch up quickly.
For example, while relatively few real estate companies were actively developing or pursuing digital and advanced analytics strategies before the pandemic, such strategies can help with tenant attraction and churn, commercial lease negotiations, asset valuation, and improved tenant experience and operations.
Other direct results of the outbreak include the need to meaningfully engage with customers and employees on health and safety in physical spaces.
In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, real estate industry leaders are taking on a set of common imperatives.
Earning the respect, trust, and loyalty of customers and employees
Above all, owners and operators have an obligation to protect the safety and health of people by all reasonable means.
For leading operators, the need to overcommunicate—to both make sure they fully understand tenants’ needs in this moment and help protect everyone in their ecosystem—is leading to some changes in behavior.
This may make the practice of communicating as a company-level brand (rather than property-level brand) more common, speeding up an existing market trend.
In B2B environments, such as offices and retail stores, CEOs and management teams may join asset managers and property managers and engage directly with tenants.
They should follow up quickly on the actions they have discussed with tenants.
Not only are such changes the right thing to do—they’re also good business: tenants and users of space will remember the effort, and the trust built throughout the crisis will go a long way toward protecting relationships and value.
Reimagining the real estate industry for the next normal
Centralizing cash management
Real estate has always been highly decentralized: many important decisions that impact cash flow have been made at the property level.
But given the uncertainty around the duration and depth of this crisis, top management is now providing more centralized direction on property-level cash management in addition to company-level balance-sheet decisions and credit lines.
All levels of management—including those at the property level and company level—are beginning to identify efficiency levers and when to pull them based on the underlying performance of properties and the business as a whole.
In the past, few properties and companies took a lean-enterprise mentality toward capital and operating expenses.
Those that do adopt lean practices and eliminate inefficiencies, however, can buy themselves a little more time to work through uncertainty.
But creativity can also be employed more often, as not all cash-creating activities need to involve cutting costs.
For example, some developers engaged in residential sales are looking into innovative ways to liquidate new inventory, such as lease-to-own programs and financing partnerships.
Making tailored, informed decisions—particularly in commercial lease concessions
While it may be tempting to make reductive assumptions about the coronavirus outbreak’s economic impact, the corresponding policy responses at city, state, and federal levels will not be uniform across real estate portfolios.
Even within a single asset, needs will vary among tenants.
Thanks to the richness of available behavioral data, select real estate leaders will use analytics to generate fact-based insights on local epidemiological and economic scenarios, what is happening to competitive assets around a property, and the impact of the crisis on individual tenants.
These perspectives can inform highly targeted decisions, rather than a one-action-fits-all-tenants approach.
Nearly every landlord is preparing for the effects of the downturn, when scores of tenants across asset classes will ask for lease concessions or abatement.
While a single policy across all tenants and properties may be easier to implement, decisions must be made for each situation, starting with a consideration of tenants’ safety and well-being.
In the office sector, factors such as price point in the market, tenant-renewal probability, tenant-default probability, local regulations, building appearance due to vacant spaces, and potential reputational risks should inform individual decisions.
Few real estate players have information about these on hand, and even fewer have the right tools, processes, and governance to make decisions.
For instance, they rarely have detailed protocols in place for what can be decided at a property level versus what should be decided centrally, as well as what tools can be used for leasing or which asset-management professionals must make these tough decisions daily.
Properly implemented, a set of clear protocols along with structured, fact-based decisioning will ensure fairness and procedural justice for tenants and help operators communicate their actions with key stakeholders, including tenants, investors, and lenders.
Taking the digital leap
Before the crisis, the real estate industry had been moving toward digitizing processes and creating digitally enabled services for tenants and users.
Practically overnight, physical distancing and the lockdown of physical spaces have magnified the importance of digitization, particularly by measures such as tenant and customer experience.
Within residential real estate, players that have invested in digital sales and leasing processes—using virtual open houses and showings; augmented and virtual reality; and omnichannel, targeted, and personalized sales—will more quickly allow their residents to find the right space for themselves.
When an operator may have to keep its amenity spaces closed for months, creating a differentiated experience will necessarily involve a suite of digital-first products and experiences: telehealth, on-demand delivery and concierge services, virtual communities, contactless access for residents, guests, and maintenance staff, and much more.
As more users adopt these digital-first products and services, users’ expectations will be raised, and players that provide a differentiated post-crisis experience will stay ahead of the curve.
These digital offerings will pay dividends in the form of superior loyalty and the ability to create brand new revenue streams while better meeting the needs of tenants and end-users.
Acquiring operating companies, not just single assets
In the context of a post-coronavirus world, most investors and operators are reconsidering all capital decisions.
Extreme uncertainty surrounding the duration of cash-flow depression and exit capitalization rates make it exceedingly challenging to underwrite acquisitions and discretionary capital expenditure with confidence.
And private market players that are not facing near-term financial distress intend to hold assets through the downturn—some view the current environment as a valuation issue, not a value issue.
Still, record-high dry powder is influencing investor attitudes.
Many have already shifted their mindsets toward finding single assets at bargain prices, though the current difficulty in accessing capital markets has delayed action, and supply may remain constrained as potential sellers wait for valuations to return.
These combined complications have caused many real estate leaders to focus on acquisitions of operating companies, large asset portfolios, and public real estate investment trusts.
Rethinking the future of real estate, now
Some landlords are now starting the process of thinking ahead to when the crisis is over.
Strategic review processes aim to understand how real estate usage might change going forward.
However, rather than relying on traditional economic or customer-survey-driven approaches, real estate leaders are looking to psychologists, sociologists, futurists, and technologists for answers.
Will employees demand larger and more enclosed workspaces?
Will people decide not to live in condominiums for fear of having to ride elevators?
While uncertainty currently reigns, by employing a range of creative personnel and using new methodologies—such as deep design interviews—business leaders may find new and more predictive insights.
As during the period following the global financial crisis of 2008, while some real estate players go beyond just adapting and flourishing, others fade.
Individual firms’ abilities to weather the storm will depend on how they respond to immediate challenges to the industry—particularly the current declines in short-term cash flow and demand for space, as well as the uncertainty surrounding commercial tenants’ ability to pay their bills.
In the medium to long term, the changed behaviors forced upon the industry will have likely altered the way consumers and businesses use and interact with real estate.
The critical question is which of these changes will stick.
Throughout, acting quickly and smartly will help determine the fate of players not only in these challenging times but also as the industry emerges from the current crisis and inevitably reinvents itself.
Airway-on-a-chip screens drugs for use against COVID-19
At a Glance Researchers used an airway-on-a-chip that mimics living lung tissue to screen approved drugs for use against SARS-CoV-2.
The most effective drug identified, called amodiaquine, is now part of a clinical trial of treatments for COVID-19.
Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University
The identification of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in January 2020 started an international rush to find drugs that could prevent or treat infection.
One potential shortcut to COVID-19 therapies is to test drugs that have already been approved for other conditions.
Such repurposing of existing drugs can greatly speed the time required for human clinical trials.
To screen drugs against viruses like SARS-CoV-2, researchers often use human cell lines grown in the lab.
These are easy to work with and relatively inexpensive.
However, they can’t replicate the complex environment of a living organ, such as the lungs.
Sometimes, drugs that work in cell lines prove ineffective—or even do harm—when later tested in people.
Hydroxychloroquine is one such example.
To help overcome this challenge, a research team led by Dr. Donald Ingber from the Wyss Institute at Harvard University has been developing organ chips for more accurate screening of drugs to treat infections.
These chips, which are about the size of a USB memory stick, provide an environment that can grow many cell types in close contact with each other.
This allows the cells to form tissues and interfaces between tissues that mimic those found within the body.
The team grew lung tissue on an Airway Chip that included cells that line the lung airway, blood vessel cells, and even immune system cells.
The tissue that grew on the chips mimicked traits seen in living lungs, such as mucus production and inflammation.
Ingber lab, Nature Biomedical Engineering
In their new study, the scientists used the Airway Chip to screen drugs for use against influenza and SARS-CoV-2.
The work was funded in part by NIH’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS).
Results were published on May 3, 2021, in Nature Biomedical Engineering.
In proof-of-concept studies using several influenza viruses, the lung tissues in the Airway Chip showed the same types of damage after viral exposure as seen in living lungs.
The drug oseltamivir, better known as Tamiflu, blocked flu virus replication in the chips over the same time period as that seen when used in people.
The team next tested drugs that were approved for other conditions for their ability to boost the effects of oseltamivir.
They found that one such drug called nafamostat helped suppress infection, doubling the time window in which oseltamivir could be effectively used.
Pivoting their efforts to COVID-19, the researchers then used the chips to identify three approved drugs—amodiaquine, toremifene, and clomiphene—that could reduce SARS-CoV-2 entry into human lung cells.
In contrast, hydroxychloroquine was among other drugs that, while working in cell lines, had no effect when tested in the Airway Chip.
The team chose the most potent, amodiaquine, for further testing.
In hamsters, amodiaquine blocked the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infected to uninfected animals by 90%.
When used after exposure as a treatment, the drug reduced the amount of virus in the body by about 70%.
Based in part on these results, amodiaquine has been incorporated into the ongoing ANTICOV clinical trial, which is testing drugs to treat COVID-19 in 13 African countries.
“Thanks to the openness and collaboration that the pandemic has sparked within the scientific community, our lead drug is now being tested in humans,” Ingber says.
“It’s a powerful testament to Organ Chips’ ability to accelerate preclinical testing.”

Intimate portraits of a hospital COVID unit from a photojournalist-turned-nurse
Enlarge this image toggle caption Alan Hawes/Medical University of South Carolina Alan Hawes/Medical University of South Carolina
Alan Hawes pulls up images on his computer that are raw and intimate, like the anguished eyes of a 72-year-old man in a hospital bed, trapped behind a mask.
"He was extremely scared, and I think that comes across in the photo," says Hawes.
"He's just kind of looking into the lens like, 'Help me.'
"
A photojournalist for nearly two decades, Hawes, 52, is used to taking pictures of people when they're most vulnerable.
Enlarge this image toggle caption Sarah Pack/Medical University of South Carolina Sarah Pack/Medical University of South Carolina
Now he works as a registered nurse at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, and the man in the picture was a patient.
"He told me, 'I don't ever want anyone to have to go through this.'
"
Neither does Hawes.
That's why he got the idea to start photographing his daily experiences with health care workers and COVID-19 patients in the critical care unit.
"If the public was more educated and could see what was going on and feel some of those emotions that I hope my photos show, I felt like it would make a bigger difference," says Hawes, whose photographs have been published by the Chicago Tribune, Sports Illustrated and The Associated Press.
Hawes especially hopes the images can change the minds of the unvaccinated.
To the frustration of health care workers, most new patients turning up at his hospital's emergency room have not been vaccinated, he says.
And as the nation braces for another deadly wave, this time due to the omicron variant, he expects the number of people seriously ill with COVID-19 to go up.
With the permission of hospital officials, health care workers and COVID-19 patients, Hawes began taking photos on his own time.
Many of the images are showcased on the hospital's Facebook page and have been featured in local news.

Those images include a respiratory therapist peering through the blinds from inside a patient's window.
She is trying to get another health care worker's attention.
She needs help to care for the patient but can't leave the room because she is in full protective gear.
Hawes says he took this shot because "it just kind of shows how isolated we are when we're in those rooms.
"
Another is a close-up of a prayer cloth sealed in a plastic bag marked "do not throw away," attached to an IV pole.
The cloth was made by a family member to provide comfort and spiritual strength to their mother, a COVID-19 patient.
The woman died in October.
Another photo captures a nurse crying after calling a patient's wife, urging her to come quickly because her husband is dying.
These are images fellow nurse Sarah Bucko, 40, knows all too well.
"I look at these pictures and I can tell you their names.
I can tell you whether they lived or died and how my co-workers were feeling that day," she says.
Bucko has worked at the hospital for nearly 20 years.
She says she loves caring for people.
But like millions of health care workers across the country, she is exhausted — physically, mentally and emotionally.

Even after she has helped save a loved one's life, she says, some family members have told her that they're still not sure they'll get vaccinated – and that the coronavirus is a hoax.
"I've been told by patients' families [who can't come to visit] that we are making this up to drum up business at the hospital," says Bucko.
"If anything," she adds, "I think these pictures show this is real.
"

But there are some people who have changed their minds about the COVID-19 vaccine and have allowed Hawes to document their stories.
Steven Murray is one such patient.
Murray, who was not vaccinated, believed he could fight off COVID-19 like the flu when he reluctantly went to the emergency room just before Labor Day.
Hawes photographed him sitting in a chair with tubes up his nose.
"I was like, 'No, not me.
I'm tough.
I'm 37 years old.
I'm not going to die,' " he says.
toggle caption Alan Hawes/Medical University of South Carolina
But within an hour of being admitted, Murray says doctors told him he would likely not leave the hospital alive if he didn't get intubated — inserting a tube into the trachea to maintain an airway.
Stubbornly, he refused and now admits he was scared he would die if put on a ventilator.
He survived.
When health care staffers asked why he'd decided against getting vaccinated, Murray says he told them, "because I'm a dumbass.
"
Murray says he bought into what he calls the misinformation and politics surrounding the pandemic.
He goes out of his way to share his story whenever he can, and "when I tell them, I'm like please, please, please get the vaccine.
If you haven't gotten it, please."
"We need to give these people a break because eventually they are going to break," says Murray.

Hawes doesn't know how people will react to his photos, but he hopes the images will be educational.

"That's what journalism is about.

CHANCELLOR’S LECTURE SERIES
Vanderbilt Chancellor’s Lecture Series strives to connect people in the Vanderbilt community and beyond with leaders and visionaries who are shaping our world.
A new USC study of a large and diverse group of Medicaid enrollees finds Latino patients had starkly higher odds of a positive COVID-19 test  as well as higher odds of hospitalization and death  than white patients.
The study of racial and ethnic differences in COVID-19 testing and outcomes included data from more than 84,000 adults at Contra Costa Regional Medical Center who were enrolled in that countys Medicaid managed care plan.
The research appears in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.
One hypothesis for worse COVID-19 outcomes among low-income people has been that they are more likely to have other preexisting health problems.
After controlling for those risks, as well as demographic and neighborhood factors, Latinos still fared worse than other groups.
That was in spite of the fact that the Latino patients were disproportionately younger.
In general, Latinos in the U.S. are healthier than whites  a phenomenon known as the Latino paradox.
Even among a population of Medicaid patients who are similarly economically disadvantaged, Latinos are shouldering an unfair burden of this deadly pandemic, said study co-author Mireille Jacobson, associate professor at the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology and senior fellow at the USC Schaeffer School for Health Policy and Economics.
The substantially higher risk facing Latinos should be a key consideration in Californias strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission and harm.
The opportunity to study a large and racially diverse low-income population at the public hospital appealed to the researchers.
They hoped to help answer questions about what was causing COVID-19s racial and ethnic disparities in communities around the country and to understand whether prior work was confounded by differences in economic status across groups.
Latinos were tested more for COVID-19 and had higher rates of infection, hospitalization and death
Health providers at the medical center observed in the early days of the pandemic that Latinos were more likely to test positive; in response, they increased their outreach to that community and urged them to get tested.
Likely because of that outreach, testing for COVID-19 was higher among Latinos than for Black, Asian or white patients, but Latinos also had much higher infection rates.
Tragically, they were also much more likely to end up hospitalized and to die from COVID-19 than white Medicaid enrollees.
COVID-19 has disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minorities in terms of infection, hospitalizations and deaths.
The interplay of social, economic and demographic factors influencing COVID outcomes remains poorly understood.
Racial and ethnic disparities in COVID vary widely across the country and seem to depend on local context, the studys authors said.
Being Latino in this population is different than being Latino in Louisiana.
Tom Chang
They point to prior studies that showed adjusted odds of hospitalization were higher for Black and Latino patients than for whites in a Wisconsin health system.
In contrast, adjusted odds of hospitalization were similar for Black and Latino patients when compared with white patients in a New York City health system.
One of the lessons we take away from this study is that being Black in Northern California is different than being Black in New York; being Latino in this population is different than being Latino in Louisiana, said study co-author Tom Chang, associate professor of finance and business economics at the USC Marshall School of Business.
Causes of racial and ethnic COVID-19 disparities remain unclear
Chang and Jacobson say the potential causes of these conflicting regional findings may be differences that havent yet been fully explored, including living and working conditions or trust of medical systems.
Another lesson is that integrated health systems could do the data analysis that revealed these disparities essentially in real time, Chang said.
In this case, the data is screamingly loud that Latinos are experiencing worse outcomes from COVID-19 and that these differences are not driven by differences in underlying health.
The USC researchers are continuing to partner with the medical center to study vaccination rates and outcomes.
We found our collaboration with Professors Chang and Jacobson tremendously valuable in helping us study the impacts of race, socioeconomics and decision-making in our health care environment, said study co-author Samir B. Shah, CEO of Contra Costa Regional Medical Center.
In unprecedented times like we are living through now, studying the effects of decisions we make in health care delivery and public health messaging are valuable in resource determination, community outreach, clinical care delivery and the transmission of fact-based information.
Additional authors include Manisha Shah at the UCLA Department of Public Policy and Rajiv Pramanik at Contra Costa Regional Medical Center & Health Centers, Contra Costa Health Services.
Account categories, properties, and activity
Figure 1 presents the pro/anti-vaccine score distributions of the accounts and tweets gathered in our analyses, which we will use to define four categories of positions on Covid-19 vaccination: pro-vaccine, vaccine promoter, vaccine inhibitor, and anti-vaccine.
The top panel displays histograms of the scores of the training set accounts that favor and disfavor vaccination, with their corresponding Gaussian distributions (with the same mean and standard deviation values).
The two training sets split into well-differentiated communities of either low (favoring vaccination) or high (disfavoring vaccination) scores.
From these distributions, we can define an approximate boundary at score 0.45 (estimated from the figure) so that accounts with scores below this threshold are defined as pro-vaccine or promoters, and above it, as anti-vaccine or inhibitors.
The bottom panel of Fig. 1 presents a histogram of the scores of all accounts (orange bars), displaying three local maxima.
The central one can be easily explained, as it corresponds to the typical score of mainstream users.
The two lower local maxima, near both edges of the histogram, are more interesting; they appear at scores that are typical of the monolithic language used by pro- or anti-vaccine activists.
Indeed, when plotting the distribution of scores per individual tweet (blue curve), we find strong peaks near these maxima, which correspond to scores associated to standardized, repetitive messages that characterize activism (see Methods for a description of the types of posts that we find with these scores).
We can thus define the local minima between the central and lateral maxima (estimated at scores 0.17 and 0.79) as the boundaries between pro- and anti-vaccine accounts that actively promote their views with monolithic statements and more moderate accounts that discuss their promoting or inhibiting positions through diverse messages.
Figure 1 Score distributions and definition of account categories (pro-vaccine, promoter, inhibitor, anti-vaccine).
Top:
Histograms of pro/anti-vaccine scores of the two training sets (one favoring and one disfavoring vaccination), and corresponding Gaussian distributions, used to estimate the boundary between accounts that favor or disfavor vaccination (vertical gray line).
Bottom: Histogram of the scores of all accounts (orange bins of width 0.02) and distribution of individual tweet scores (blue curve).
The histogram maximum corresponds to the score of the most common views.
The local maxima at both sides and peaks in the distribution curve (labeled by red dashed lines) match the scores of activist messages, since these use repetitive language that results in similar values.
The histogram’s local minima are thus used to define the boundaries between pro/anti-vaccine activist and moderate accounts (vertical gray lines).
Full size image
Using these boundaries, we were able to classify the accounts based not only on whether they favor or disfavor vaccination but also on their level of activism in propagating their viewpoints.
We defined all accounts with scores from 0 to 0.17 as pro-vaccine, from 0.17 to 0.45 as promoters, from 0.45 to 0.79 as inhibitors, and from 0.79 to 1 as anti-vaccine.
Note that all four categories emerged naturally from our language analysis, despite starting from a binary training set.
Although their exact ranges will always be somewhat arbitrary, we verified that small changes do not significantly affect the results presented below.
Figure 2 compares the activity of the four account categories defined above.
Its left column includes all users and its right column, only the top 10% of accounts with the highest total number of interactions.
The top panels show that most accounts have moderate (promoter or inhibitor) positions and that anti-vaccine accounts are a relatively small minority.
Regarding their activity, the central panels show that the mean number of tweets per account ranges roughly from 4 to 7 in all categories but can be more than 50 in the pro- and anti-vaccine accounts among the 10% with most interactions, which is about double the number of tweets produced by moderate accounts.
It is remarkable that individual anti-vaccine activists can reach activity levels similar to those of pro-vaccine accounts, since the latter are often institutional and thus have dedicated communication teams.
Finally, regarding the level of success in propagating their views, the lower panels show that pro- and anti-vaccine accounts receive a similar number of interactions, which is also remarkable given Twitter’s pro-vaccine information campaigns and restrictions on the propagation of anti-vaccine messages.
Figure 2 Accounts and activity per category.
Bar charts of the number of accounts, mean number of tweets per account, and mean number of interactions per tweet for the four account categories (pro-vaccine, promoter, inhibitor, anti-vaccine), averaged either over all accounts (left column) or over the top 10% with most interactions (right column).
Promoter accounts appear as the largest category, followed by inhibitors.
The top 10% pro/anti-vaccine activist accounts tweet significantly more than the moderates.
Despite their smaller number and lack of centralized organization, anti-vaccine accounts generate significant activity.

Figure 3 presents the activity of the different categories over time.
The top graph shows the fraction of accounts of each type that were activated per month (i.e., that tweeted at least once), the central graph, their mean number of tweets, and the bottom graph, their mean score.
We find that the number of activated accounts per category changes with the contingencies of the vaccination process, but not their typical tweeting behavior or mean opinions.
Indeed, in June, Chile experienced a large peak in the number of cases while it surpassed 50% of its population vaccinated with at least one dose, which led to high levels of public controversy regarding the effectiveness of the vaccination process (see supplementary text).
During this period, the number of activated accounts increased in all categories, except for the pro-vaccine category, which appears to follow a more institutional approach that does not react to contingencies.
In addition, activated anti-vaccine accounts showed the highest relative increase.
On the other hand, the mean number of tweets per account and mean score remained relatively constant for each category, seeming not to be strongly affected by the public debate.
Figure 3 Temporal dynamics of the accounts and activity per category.
Monthly values of the fraction of active accounts (that tweeted at least once in a month), number of tweets per account, and opinion scores for each category.
Although the number of active accounts appears to increase in periods of controversy regarding vaccination, their mean opinions and activity do not significantly change.
The sustained activity increase of pro-vaccine accounts can be attributed to the proliferation of informative messages and appeals to get vaccinated by organizations related to the vaccination campaign.

Interaction network and information flow
We now turn our attention to the network of interactions between accounts.
Figure 4 displays the giant component of all accounts that interacted during the period of analysis26,27.
Each node corresponds to an account, colored according to its category, and the links represent interactions between accounts (replies, citations, or references).
We observe that accounts that favor or disfavor vaccination do not segregate into clearly defined communities, although the force-directed graph presented in the figure does tend to place some of the nodes that belong to the same category near each other, evidencing the presence of enhanced interactions between them.
The anti-vaccine community thus seems centered in the top-right region, whereas pro-vaccine accounts mainly appear in the top-left region, where we also find several accounts with high PageRank28,29 values (represented by large nodes) that are well connected because they typically belong to organizations or public figures involved in vaccine promotion.
Figure 4 Network of Twitter interactions regarding the Covid-19 vaccination process in Chile.
Each node is an account; each link represents replies, citations, or references between accounts.
The displayed network is the giant component of all classified nodes that tweeted at least twice about the vaccination process during the 6 months of collected data, consisting of 10,275 nodes and 23,336 links.
The anti-vaccine (dark red) and inhibitor accounts (light red) appear to group at the top right side while the pro-vaccine (dark green) and promoter (light green) accounts appear to group at the top left side.
This is due to the display algorithm, which places closer together the more highly connected groups of nodes.

Figure 5 displays three charts that characterize the mean topological properties30,31 of the nodes of each category in the complete interaction network that includes all categories and the unclassified nodes linked to them.
The mean PageRank reflects the influential position of pro-vaccine accounts in Chilean society.
The clustering coefficient, however, shows that these tend to create tight-knit groups; most of their connections also interact with each other and thus have reduced outreach to other communities.
This may result in part from their observed tendency to tag other pro-vaccine accounts.
Finally, the low betweenness centrality of anti-vaccine accounts shows that they tend to appear in the periphery of the conversations.
This is consistent with the widespread vaccination acceptance in Chile, where anti-vaccine communities have not connected with any mainstream narrative or sociopolitical movement.
Figure 5 Bar charts displaying three standard network measures, averaged over all nodes in each category, within the complete network (also including non-classified nodes that interacted with the classified accounts).
The top two charts show that pro-vaccine accounts have better quality connections (higher PageRank) but tend to form more triangular structures with nodes that also interact with each other (higher clustering coefficient), which is consistent with the overrepresentation of accounts of institutions and authorities in this category.
The bottom chart shows the lower betweenness centrality of the inhibitor and anti-vaccine accounts, which can be interpreted as a positive diagnostic since it reflects their peripheral positions in the national conversation.

To further explore the communication between and within categories, we present in Fig.
6 the segregated networks (formed by the nodes of a single category) and the online information fluxes between them.
We find that the networks for different categories display very different features, which is apparent in the diagrams displayed inside each circle.
The pro-vaccine subnetwork has the highest density of internal connections (0.015% of all possible connections) and a large giant component, with over 51% of nodes.
The promoter subnetwork has the second-highest connectivity density (0.0083%) and the largest giant component, with over 64% of all its nodes.
The inhibitor subnetwork has the lowest internal connectivity density (0.0048%) and its giant component includes only 28% of its nodes.
Finally, the anti-vaccine accounts disaggregate into multiple parts and, although the mean density of connections is not as low (0.0076%), it has a very small giant connected component, conformed by only 5% of the accounts in this category.
Figure 6 Subnetworks of only pro-vaccine (left), promoter (center-left), inhibitor (center-right), or anti-vaccine (right) nodes and their interaction flows.
Each circle contains an image of the network that is obtained when considering only nodes of a given category and the links that connect them.
We observe in these network images that pro-vaccine accounts form a well-connected network with a large giant component, whereas anti-vaccine accounts fragment into multiple individual nodes and small networks.
Promoters and inhibitors form the largest networks, but the latter has a much lower connection density than the former.
The arrows between networks show the percentage of interactions (replies, citations, and references) that accounts in each category dedicate to others.
We note that pro-vaccine accounts tend to interact with other pro-vaccine accounts or with promoters, whereas anti-vaccine accounts dedicate significant efforts to interacting with pro-vaccine accounts.
This can be assessed as a communications problem, since vaccine skeptics rarely have their doubts addressed by the pro-vaccine community while anti-vaccine activists intervene in most pro-vaccine conversations.
Full size image
Figure 6 also displays the percentage of interactions (sum of all replies, citations, and references) that each category addresses to members of other categories and of its own.
The results show that users that disfavor vaccination address much more often groups that favor vaccination than vice-versa.
For example, over 25% of the tweets by anti-vaccine users address pro-vaccine accounts, whereas only 0.3% of pro-vaccine tweets address anti-vaccine accounts.
Also, 54% of inhibitor messages address promoters, but only 13% of promoter tweets address inhibitors.
Furthermore, users that favor vaccination tend to communicate within their own category, whereas those that disfavor vaccinations mainly focus on engaging with other categories.
Although all this is partly due to the different number of accounts in each category, these percentages still reflect the types of accounts that their users seek to interact with.
Moreover, our data show that, even after correcting for category size, pro-vaccine accounts still have a strong tendency to address likeminded accounts, whereas anti-vaccine accounts are constantly trying to argue with accounts that favor vaccination.
NIH launches study of third COVID-19 vaccine dose in kidney transplant recipients
Trial will assess antibody response in people who did not respond to two-dose regimen.
NIAID
What
A pilot study has begun to assess the antibody response to a third dose of an authorized COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in kidney transplant recipients who did not respond to two doses of the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.
The Phase 2 trial is sponsored and funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health.
The lifelong immunosuppressive therapy that organ transplant recipients must take to prevent organ rejection blunts their immune response to both pathogens and vaccines.
Research has shown that many organ transplant recipients do not develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, after receiving an authorized COVID-19 vaccine regimen.
The purpose of the new study is to determine whether a third dose of one of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines could overcome this problem for at least some kidney transplant recipients.
This is particularly important because this population has a high prevalence of conditions that are risk factors for severe COVID-19, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
The pilot study also aims to identify characteristics that could help distinguish those kidney transplant recipients who would benefit from a third dose of an mRNA vaccine from those who will require a different approach to achieve protection.
The pilot study findings will inform a subsequent, larger phase of the trial that includes higher-risk strategies to induce a protective immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in solid organ transplant recipients who do not respond to a third dose of an mRNA vaccine.
The third-dose vaccine intervention was chosen because of the demonstrated safety of the two-dose mRNA vaccine regimen in solid organ transplant recipients as well as the efficacy of additional doses of other vaccines, such as those for hepatitis and influenza, in immunocompromised people.
The pilot study, called COVID Protection After Transplant (CPAT), is being conducted at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore under the leadership of Dorry Segev, M.D., Ph.D. Dr. Segev is the Marjory K. and Thomas Pozefsky professor of surgery and epidemiology, associate vice chair of the department of surgery, and director of the Epidemiology Research Group in Organ Transplantation at Johns Hopkins University.
The CPAT study team will enroll up to 200 adults ages 18 years or older who received a kidney transplant a year or more prior to enrollment and have had no recent organ rejection or change in immunosuppression.
Between 50 and 100 participants will have had no detectable antibody response to two doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, and 50 to 100 participants will have had a low response.
All participants will receive a third dose of the same COVID-19 vaccine that they received previously.
Thirty days later, investigators will measure participants’ antibody response to the third dose.
The goal is to determine the proportion of participants who achieve a designated antibody response at the 30-day mark.
The study team will follow participants for one year after enrollment.
Preliminary results are expected in September 2021.

Research conducted by Tong Li, Gertrude Conaway Vanderbilt Chair in Social and Natural Sciences and professor of economics, shows that Tennessee’s expansion of testing policy during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have decreased the number of cases in the state relative to what they would have been if the policy had not been implemented.
When Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee announced on April 15, 2020, that free COVID-19 tests were available for any Tennessean, regardless of traditional symptoms, Li saw one of the most unique opportunities of his career.
“In the context of assessing COVID policies, Tennessee was a very good place for us as researchers to answer some really important questions that are very difficult to address in traditional circumstances,” Li said.
“With Tennessee’s open COVID testing policy, we had solid footing, in terms of the number of confirmed cases, that could be used in a statistical evaluation of the effectiveness of public health policies implemented during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The idea was to combine policy evaluation identifying assumptions that are standard practice in economics with reasonable assumptions to account for actual COVID-19 cases in a particular location that were not diagnosed.”
Typically, it is difficult to accurately estimate or assess the impact of policy interventions without bias because of missing data that is not randomly distributed.
In the case of COVID, that missing and non-randomly distributed data included: confirmed number of cases in specific areas, the number of actual cases, test availability and non-random testing because “individuals who were more likely to have had COVID-19 were more likely to have taken a COVID-19 test due to both self-selection as well as eligibility requirements for taking the test, such as being in a particular risk group or exhibiting certain symptoms,” Li and his co-author, Brantly Callaway, Ph.D.’16, assistant professor of economics at University of Georgia, wrote.
Once the state’s open testing policy was announced, more than 23,000 individuals were tested at 67 sites in the next three weekends.
Relative to Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi and North Carolina (all states that border Tennessee), by the end of March, Tennessee was conducting more per capita tests per day than any of these states, the authors stated.
The results of their analysis of COVID cases identified through the state’s open testing policy show:
Considerable evidence that Tennessee’s expanded testing reduced actual COVID-19 cases by an estimated 8,058 cases relative to the number of cases that would have occurred without the policy.
Expanded testing in the state appears to have reduced the number of COVID-19 deaths by at least 80 in Tennessee as well as lowered COVID-19 hospitalizations relative to other states being considered.
Costs of expanded testing were so low that essentially any reduction in the number of deaths due to the policy would justify its cost.
Li’s work has implications for measuring many policy outcomes, and he is sharing the methodology with Vanderbilt faculty and external collaborators who conduct statistical analysis on a range of topics.

The article, “Evaluating Policies Early in a Pandemic: Bounding Policy Effects with Nonrandomly Missing Data” is available as a preprint and will be published in the journal Review of Economics and Statistics.
Polarized views and worries about COVID-19 vaccination had spillover effects on flu vaccination in adults, according to researchers who examined data over two pandemic years on both vaccines by state.
The authors of the study say the findings are a warning of declining trust in public heath, which comes at a vulnerable time as eased COVID-19 measures put populations at risk for the return of disease threats such as flu.
Late-season flu activity is still under way in some parts of the United States, and health officials are closely watching Australia, where an early-season surge is already worse than some of the country's pre–COVID pandemic flu seasons.
The group, based at University of California-Los Angeles Health Services, published its findings yesterday in a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine.
Erosion in faith seen in clinical practice
For their observational study, the group looked at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data on uptake for both vaccines though Jan 2022.
During the first pandemic year, flu vaccination rates held steady.
In the second pandemic year, however, when COVID-19 vaccines were widely available and promoted, flu vaccination rates fell 4.5 percentage points (from 43.7% to 39.2%) in states with below-average COVID-19 vaccination rates.
In contrast, the researchers saw a positive spillover effect on flu vaccination in states that had strong COVID-19 vaccine uptake, with an increase that averaged 3.8 percentage points (from 49.0% to 52.8%).
Uptake of both vaccines by state were highly variable.
For example, for the full COVID-19 vaccination, levels through Jan 2022 ranged from 50% in Alabama to 81% in Rhode Island.
For the flu vaccine during the same time, levels ranged from 31% in Mississippi to 59% in Connecticut.
The researchers estimated that a state's COVID-19 vaccination rate could predict 60% of its flu vaccination rate.
The study's lead author, Richard Leuchter, MD, a resident physician at UCLA Health, in a press release aired worries that people who never declined life-saving vaccines before are now foregoing them in the wake of controversy surrounding COVID-19 vaccination.
"This supports what I have seen in my clinical practice and suggests that information and policies specific to Covid-19 vaccines may be eroding more general faith in medicine and our government’s role in public health.
"
Need for understanding uptake, policy lessons
The group wrote that spillovers that either eroded or boosted flu vaccination might be explained by "belief generalization."
Leuchter said those who felt compelled to oppose or support COVID-19 vaccination may feel that they should reject or accept other vaccines.
He said, however, that belief generalization goes only so far to account for vaccination trends for kids, which declined for both flu seasons, even in states with high COVID-19 vaccine uptake.
One reassuring finding was that flu vaccination levels remained relatively stable for those 65 years or older, a group at increased risk for complications.
The authors added key caveats, noting that the observational study didn't directly measure people's beliefs or prove that mistrust of vaccines or government drove down flu vaccination rates.
They said the findings, though, are alarming and should trigger studies on the root causes of poor COVID-19 vaccination rates, insights that are needed to guide future policies.
Bridgetown, Barbados, 7 April 2021 (PAHO / WHO) - St. Vincent and the Grenadines today received 24,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX Facility, a global effort between the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
The arrival marks a historic step toward ensuring the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines worldwide, in the largest vaccine procurement and supply operation in history.
This delivery is part of the first phase of deliveries for St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and more vaccines are expected to arrive successively during 2021.
According to the first round of COVAX allocations, St. Vincent and the Grenadines is expected to continue receiving doses through May until it reaches 45,600, the amount specified by COVAX.
PAHO's Revolving Fund, which is responsible for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines for the countries of the Americas under the COVAX Mechanism, sent 24,000 doses of the AstraZeneca / Oxford vaccine, manufactured by SK Bioscience of South Korea.
The vaccines arrived today at the Argyle International Airport.
Seeing this arrival is very reassuring and it means that more people will be able to be protected from COVID-19, "said Dr. Yitades Gebre, PAHO / WHO Representative for Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean Countries."
We will continue to work with the country to support vaccination along with the entire package of known public health and social measures that we know can help stop the spread of COVID-19, protect health services, and save lives.
"
The arrival of these first vaccines will serve to protect priority groups and those most at risk, such as health workers and older adults.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines is one of ten countries in the Americas that are receiving vaccines at no cost through the COVAX Mechanism's Advance market commitment (AMC).
The Hon.
St. Clair Prince, Minister of Health, Wellness and the Environment said, “We believe as do most experts in the field that vaccination is the best hope of ending the COVID-19 pandemic.
As a result, government has always been trying to procure vaccines from all sources possible to ensure that Vincentians have access to this very vital item.
”
Since the first case of COVID-19 was reported in March 2020, the country has recorded 1,766 cases and 10 deaths as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
“The UN welcomes the first delivery of COVID-19 vaccine to St. Vincent and the Grenadines, under the COVAX facility, since it brings countries one step closer to fully protecting their most vulnerable.
We have learned the hard way that this virus has no borders, and our goal is to leave no country behind through universal access to vaccines.
The only way that we can save lives, and ultimately end this crisis, is by ensuring that all countries are able to offer vaccinations to their whole population.
The COVAX mechanism is a tangible reflection of this goal, made possible thanks to the solidarity of the international community.
We are truly grateful to our many partners for their support, ”said UN Resident Coordinator, Didier Trebucq.
“The arrival of these vaccines provides a critical tool in the fight against COVID-19, which has been battering essential services that secure the education and protection of our children.
UNICEF will continue to support the communication campaign which seeks to drive adult vaccination as an important step towards controlling the pandemic, so that we can begin to reimagine a better, safer and healthier future for everyone, especially children, young people and their families, ” said UNICEF Representative for the Eastern Caribbean Area, Dr Aloys Kamuragiye.
COVAX seeks to provide vaccines for at least 20% of the population of each participating country during 2021.
In this first round of vaccine allocation, all COVAX participating countries will receive doses to vaccinate between 2.2 and 2.6% of their population.
The only exceptions are small island developing States, which will receive an allocation of vaccines to cover between 16 and 20% of their population, due to the high logistical cost of delivering small quantities of vaccines.
Until vaccination is widespread among the population, basic public health measures remain the basis of the pandemic response.
For public health authorities, this means continuing to conduct screening, contact tracing, isolation, assisted quarantine, and quality care.
And for people, it means continuing to practice physical distancing, hand hygiene, the use of masks, adequate ventilation of indoor environments, and avoidance of crowded spaces.
COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance Gavi) and the World Health Organization (WHO) - working in partnership with UNICEF as key implementing partner, as well as civil society organizations, vaccine manufacturers, the World Bank, and others.
In the Americas, the PAHO Revolving Fund is the recognized procurement agent for the COVAX facility.

Below is a Viewpoint from Chapter 1 of the Foresight Africa 2021 report , which explores top priorities for the region in the coming year.
This year’s issue focuses on strategies for Africa to confront the twin health and economic crises created by the COVID-19 pandemic and emerge stronger than ever.
Read the full chapter on the great reset .
For the past few years, as part of a project on creating jobs for the region’s burgeoning youth population, the Brookings Africa Growth Initiative has been examining how services subsectors that mimic traditional manufacturing—in that they are tradable, have high value-added per worker, have the capacity for learning and productivity growth—can absorb large numbers of low- to moderately skilled labor.
Sub-Saharan Africa’s services-led economic growth has been under increasing strain due to COVID-19.
Beyond the threats to health and livelihoods the pandemic has thrown a wrench into some of the most promising sectors for economic growth in the region—including its “industries without smokestacks” (IWOSS).
One of the key industries without smokestacks is tourism.
Its decline in the face of this unprecedented global pandemic may tell a cautionary tale for tourism-dependent economies in Africa and elsewhere.
Indeed, under COVID-19, the economic outlook is particularly uncertain for African countries with contact-intensive sectors such as tourism, hospitality, entertainment, and transportation.
Tourism is an important driver of economic growth around the world.
In 2014, the industry provided an estimated 277 million jobs and accounted for about 9.8 percent of global GDP.
Blessed with beaches, cultural sites, and abundant wildlife, prior to the pandemic, Africa had the second-fasting growing tourism sector in the world.
In fact, tourism represents about 8.5 percent of Africa’s GDP and employs around 24 million people.
With the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of international tourist arrivals has decreased sharply.
From April to June 2020, the number of international tourists arriving in Africa fell by 98 percent, compared to that same period the year before.
While some countries have had a partial resumption of passenger traffic, demand is not expected to reach its pre-COVID levels before 2023.
Moreover, the pandemic has severely affected sectors where women’s employment is disproportionately high, such as hotels and restaurants.
As a result, tourism-dependent economies are estimated by the African Development Bank to experience sharp declines in growth in 2020.
Mauritius (-14.9 percent), Seychelles (-12 percent), and Cabo Verde (-6.6 percent) will be especially hard hit but are expected to recover in 2021.
Exchange rate volatility is particularly severe in those economies too.
The pandemic will have far-reaching implications for productive employment, especially for low-skilled youth, in such roles as cooks, waitrons, and front office staff.
Between 2010 and 2018, the average share of employment in travel and tourism in total employment in Ethiopia was 8.4 percent.
Kenya’s tourism sector—pre-pandemic— employed about 1 million workers, accounting for 9.2 percent of total workers.
In Rwanda, tourism employs more than 3 percent of the labor force, including low-skilled workers.
Ten million tourists visited South Africa in 2017—by far the most in sub-Saharan Africa.
In 2018, there were an estimated 849,000 formal private sector jobs in tourism there, representing 5 percent of total employment.
In Uganda, tourism firms employ a high share of youth in their total work force (47.5 percent).
WASHINGTON (AP) —
President Joe Biden is asking Congress to provide more than $47 billion in emergency dollars that would go toward the war in Ukraine, the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing monkeypox outbreak and help for recent natural disasters in Kentucky and other states.
The request, which comes as lawmakers are preparing to return to Washington and fund the government, includes $13.7 billion related to Ukraine, including money for equipment, intelligence support and direct budgetary support.
Shalanda Young, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said that more than three-fourths of the $40 billion approved by Congress earlier this year has already been disbursed or committed.

“We have rallied the world to support the people of Ukraine as they defend their democracy and we cannot allow that support to Ukraine to run dry,” Young said in a blog post.
The White House request will play into congressional budget negotiations in the coming weeks as financing for federal agencies is set to run out Sept. 30.
Both parties will be seeking to avoid a government shutdown in the weeks before the midterm elections, but they will have to work out differences over issues like the COVID-19 aid, which has been a sticking point for many months as the White House has said more money is needed for vaccines and testing and Republicans have pointed to the trillions that have already been approved and money that is still unspent.
In Friday’s request, the White House is seeking $7.1 billion to procure additional vaccines and for replenishing personal protective equipment in the Strategic National Stockpile, among other measures.
It is also seeking $2 billion to continue testing programs, including an initiative to distribute free at-home tests that ended on Friday as the government says it is running short on funds.
White House officials say they have some tests left in the stockpile, but not enough to provide free tests if cases sharply increase.
Congress also has not moved forward on President Joe Biden’s $22.5 billion request earlier this year for the COVID-19 response.
And funding is drying up for many of the community groups that received millions of federal tax dollars to encourage vaccinations.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the White House has repeatedly warned that there would be trade-offs if that money wasn’t approved, and “that is precisely what happened.”
The lack of free testing kits, for example, “leaves our domestic testing capacity diminished for a potential fall surge,” she said.
The administration is also asking for $4.5 billion to bolster its efforts to fight monkeypox.
Officials said they have already depleted significant reserves from the national stockpile to provide over 1.1 million vials of vaccine.
The money would help ensure access to vaccinations, testing and treatment, and also help fund the global effort to fight the disease, administration officials said.
It dawned on Eian Kantor on a Saturday in early April as he brewed a cup of tea from fresh mint leaves: he had lost his sense of smell.
The tea suspiciously smelled of nothing at all.
Kantor proceeded to rifle through the fridge, sniffing jars of pickles, chili sauce and garlic—nothing.
Ever since New York State went into lockdown in late March, Kantor, age 30, and his girlfriend had stayed isolated in their Queens, N.Y., apartment.
So he did not suspect he had COVID-19 despite running a slight fever that he chalked up to seasonal allergies.
When he was finally able to get tested weeks into his loss of smell, or anosmia, he tested negative.
But months later, he says, several tests showed that his antibodies to the novel coronavirus were “off-the-charts high, which affirmed that I had had it.”
An estimated 80 percent of people with COVID-19 have smell disturbances, and many also have dysgeusia or ageusia (a disruption or loss of taste, respectively) or changes in chemesthesis (the ability to sense chemical irritants such as hot chilies).
Smell loss is so common in people with the disease that some researchers have recommended its use as a diagnostic test because it may be a more reliable marker than fever or other symptoms.

One lingering mystery is how the novel coronavirus robs its victims of these senses.
Early in the pandemic, physicians and researchers worried that COVID-related anosmia might signal that the virus makes its way into the brain through the nose, where it could do severe and lasting damage.
A suspected route would be via the olfactory neurons that sense odors in the air and transmit these signals to the brain.
But studies have shown that this is probably not the case, says Sandeep Robert Datta, a neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School.
“My gestalt read of the data to date suggests that the primary source of insult is actually in the nose, in the nasal epithelium,” the skinlike layer of cells responsible for registering odors.
“It looks like the virus attacks, predominantly, support cells and stem cells and not neurons directly,” Datta says.
But that fact does not mean that neurons cannot be affected, he emphasizes.
Olfactory neurons do not have angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, which allow the virus entry to cells, on their surface.
But sustentacular cells, which support olfactory neurons in important ways, are studded with the receptors.
These cells maintain the delicate balance of salt ions in the mucus that neurons depend on to send signals to the brain.
If that balance is disrupted, it could lead to a shutdown of neuronal signaling—and therefore of smell.
The sustentacular cells also provide the metabolic and physical support needed to sustain the fingerlike cilia on the olfactory neurons where receptors that detect odors are concentrated.
“If you physically disrupt those cilia, you lose the ability to smell,” Datta says.
In a study in Brain, Behavior and Immunity, Nicolas Meunier, a neuroscientist at Paris-Saclay University in France, infected the noses of golden Syrian hamsters with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID.
Just two days later about half of the hamsters' sustentacular cells were infected.
But olfactory neurons were not infected even after two weeks.
And strikingly, the olfactory epithelia were completely detached, which, Meunier says, resembled skin peeling after a sunburn.
Although olfactory neurons were not infected, their cilia were entirely gone.
“If you remove the cilia, you remove the olfactory receptors and the ability to detect odorants,” he says.
Disruption of the olfactory epithelium could explain the loss of smell.
Yet it remains unclear whether the damage is done by the virus itself or invading immune cells, which Meunier observed after infection.
Widespread reports of anosmia with COVID are not typical of other diseases caused by viruses.
“We think it's very specific to SARS-CoV-2,” Meunier says.
In a previous study with other respiratory viruses at his laboratory, he found sustentacular cells infected only rarely, whereas with SARS-CoV-2, about half of cells contained the pathogen.
With other viruses, smell is usually compromised by a stuffed-up nose, but COVID does not usually cause nasal congestion.
“This is very different,” Meunier says.
Researchers have found a few clues about the loss of smell, but they are less certain about how the virus causes a loss of taste.
Taste receptor cells, which detect chemicals in the saliva and send signals to the brain, do not contain ACE2, so they probably do not get infected by SARS-CoV-2.
But other support cells in the tongue carry the receptor, perhaps providing some indication of why taste goes away.
(Although taste can seem to disappear with anosmia because odors are such a key component of flavor, many people with COVID truly develop ageusia and cannot detect even sweet or salty taste.)
The loss of chemical sensing—the burn of hot chilies or the refreshing sensation of mint—also remains unexplained and largely unexplored.
These sensations are not tastes.
Instead their detection is conveyed by pain-sensing nerves—some of which contain ACE2—throughout the body, including the mouth.
More clues to how the virus obliterates smell come from people recovering from anosmia.
“The majority of patients lose smell like a light switch going off and recover it rapidly,” Datta says.
“There's a fraction of patients that have much more persistent anosmia and recover on longer time scales.”
The olfactory epithelium regularly regenerates.
“That's the body's way of protecting against the constant onslaught of toxins in the environment,” Meunier says.
Still, more than seven months after he first experienced anosmia, Kantor falls in the second group of patients: he has yet to detect any odors at all.
“It's hard because you don't realize how much you relate to smell until you lose it,” he says.
“If the house were on fire, I wouldn't know it.
It's very concerning.”
And then there is what anosmia does to the joy of eating.
“Foods that used to be good now taste ‘meh,’” Kantor says.
Carol Yan, a rhinologist at the University of California, San Diego, says that anosmia poses a real health risk.
“It actually increases mortality.
If you can't smell and taste food, it can predispose you to harm, like rotten food or a gas leak,” she says.
“It can also cause social withdrawal or nutritional deficits.”
The variation on sensory themes extends to another symptom called parosmia, a possible sign of recovery in people with long-lasting anosmia.
Freya Sawbridge, a 27-year-old New Zealand woman, is such an individual.
She contracted COVID-19 in March.
After several weeks of anosmia and ageusia, when everything tasted of “ice cubes and cardboard,” she says, Sawbridge began to regain the most basic tastes—sweet, salty, sour—but no nuance of flavor, which comes from foods' aromas.
“Chocolate tastes like sweet rubber,” she says.
Then, after about five months, some odors returned but not as expected.
For a while, all foods smelled of artificial strawberry flavor.
But now “everything smells hideous and distorted,” Sawbridge says.
“Nothing is accurate, and the odors are all unpleasant.”
The smell of onions, she says, is unbearable, and a strange chemical flavor permeates everything.
“All my food tastes like it was sprayed with window cleaner,” Sawbridge adds.
Parosmia may occur when newly grown stem cells that develop into neurons in the nose attempt to extend their long fibers, called axons, through tiny holes in the base of the skull and connect with a structure in the brain called the olfactory bulb.
Sometimes axons connect to the wrong place, causing erratic smell, but the miswiring can potentially correct itself, given enough time.
That news is welcome for people such as Sawbridge.
But the question she wants answered is: How long will her condition last?
“We don't know the final time course of recovery for those with anosmia,” Yan says, but it is usually from six months to a year.
“With long-term postviral smell loss from the flu, after six months, there is a 30 to 50 percent chance of spontaneous recovery” without any treatment, she adds.
“There have been case reports of recovery after two years.
But after that, we think the regenerative capability may be hindered.
And the chances of recovery are quite slim, unfortunately.”
Kantor has tried every avenue imaginable to regain his sense of smell: a course of high-dose steroids to reduce inflammation; a smell-training program with essential oils; beta-carotene supplements for nerve regeneration; acupuncture.
Nothing has made a difference.
Yan recommends “irrigation” of the sinuses with budesonide, a topical steroid shown to improve outcomes in a Stanford University study of people with postflu smell loss for more than six months.
Another promising treatment Yan and others are investigating is platelet-rich plasma, an anti-inflammatory concoction isolated from blood that has been used to treat some types of nerve damage.
But with any treatment, Yan says, the results “are not amazing.
It's not like you'll wake up and say, ‘Wow, I can smell again.’
But if you can smell soap again or enjoy the taste of some foods, that's a big gain.”
There is one final worrying note about anosmia: it has been identified as a risk factor for some neurodegenerative diseases.
“After the flu pandemic of 1919, we saw an increase in the prevalence of Parkinson's disease,” Meunier says.
“It would be really concerning if something similar were happening here.”
But Yan thinks that fear is overblown.
“There is certainly a link between anosmia and diseases, but we think that viral-induced anosmia is [working by] a totally different mechanism,” she says.
“Having postviral anosmia doesn't put you at higher risk for disease.
These are two completely separate phenomena.”
That should reassure Sawbridge and Kantor—and the millions of others worldwide affected with COVID-related smell loss.
A team of researchers has developed an inhalable vaccine that successfully protects against the COVID virus.
It also opens the door to delivering other messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics for gene replacement therapy and other treatments in the lungs.
Results of the study, led by W. Mark Saltzman, PhD, are published in Science Translational Medicine.
For the vaccine, the researchers demonstrated that two intranasal doses of the treatment, made with nanoparticles carrying mRNA COVID vaccine, is effective in mice.
It also demonstrates that an inhalable delivery system allows for minimally invasive and lung-targeted mRNA delivery, potentially applicable for numerous pulmonary diseases in addition to COVID.
It’s a significant advance since scientists have had trouble creating lung-targeted mRNA therapies.
Typically, these therapies have had poor transfection efficiency.
That is, only a small fraction of administered nucleic acids make it into cells that lead to expression of the encoded protein.
Also, in the past, the nanoparticles that deliver the mRNA have caused inflammation and other problems.
The Saltzman group got around this hurdle in part by using a nanoparticle made from poly(amine-co-ester) polyplexes, or PACE, a biocompatible and highly customizable polymer.
We just gave two doses, a prime and a boost, intranasally, and we got a highly protective immune response.
But we also showed that, generally, you can deliver different kinds of mRNA.
W. Mark Saltzman, PhD
Saltzman previously worked with the lab of Akiko Iwasaki, PhD, Sterling Professor of Immunology, and professor of molecular, cellular & developmental biology on what Iwasaki calls a “prime and spike” COVID vaccine delivery system.
The “prime” half of the system involves injections of the mRNA vaccine into a muscle, the shot that millions of people have already received.
These vaccinations were followed up with familiar spike proteins or spike mRNA that are derived from the coronavirus and are sprayed directly into the nose.
In their new study, the researchers showed that the shot isn’t necessary to provide protection.
“In the new report, there is no intramuscular injection,” said Saltzman, the Goizueta Foundation Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Chemical & Environmental Engineering & Physiology, and a member of Yale Cancer Center.
“We just gave two doses, a prime and a boost, intranasally, and we got a highly protective immune response.
But we also showed that, generally, you can deliver different kinds of mRNA.
So it's not just good for a vaccine, but potentially also good for gene replacement therapy in diseases like cystic fibrosis and gene editing.
We used a vaccine example to show that it works, but it opens the door to doing all these other kinds of interventions.”
Without the protective casing of the nanoparticles, the mRNA would quickly deteriorate inside the body.
However, developing a nanoparticle for lung-targeted therapies has been tricky.
Other attempts to develop an inhalable delivery system for mRNA have met obstacles due to the type of material used for the nanoparticles.
“It's been a challenge trying to take the lipid nanoparticle vaccine delivery systems and make them active through the nose as well,” Saltzman said.
“One of the advantages we have is that the PACE polymer that we're using seems to be much milder, and much better tolerated in the lung than lipid nanoparticles are.”
A previous study from the Saltzman lab characterized PACE polymers with various chemical end-groups.
“There are a lot of chemistries that govern the transfection efficiency of mRNA, and we chose the top candidates and then tested them for our work,” said Hee Won Suh, PhD, an associate research scientist in the Saltzman lab, and co-corresponding author of the paper.
It’s a process that took a fair amount of trial and error.
“We have guiding design principles, but it was not perfectly understood which formulation would be best,” said Alexandra Suberi, a PhD student in the Saltzman lab and lead author of the paper.
“We screened formulations with varying amine structures and polyethylene glycol content to find a formulation that would work well in lung cells.
The end-group and PEG content both had a large effect on protein expression.”
The next step, the researchers say, is to test the delivery system for other therapeutic applications.
A week ago, we embarked on a project with the MIT Sloan Management Review and CultureX to find out what HR teams around the world are doing to respond to the COVID-19 crisis.
The answer is: a lot.
The Covid HR-Pulse is open throughout this crisis.
Please take our brief survey to describe your company’s response to the crisis as we update findings weekly.
Based on last week’s survey and discussions, here is what we discovered.
Top HR Priorities
First, crisis response has become top priority for HR.
As Sally Sourbron, head of HR for ServiceNow Europe noted, ServiceNow’s response fell into three urgent areas: communication, remote work, and reporting.
The cloud computing company immediately developed a global response team (led by the CIO) and created a set of channels for communication, tools for remote work, and daily reporting capabilities on infection, location, and information about work at home.
These measures address some of employees’ most pressing concerns while transitioning to a remote workplace.
Daily crisis standups provide regular, stable updates to employees as they worry about their future, clarifying roles and responsibilities as they shift in real-time.
New reporting capabilities allow the company to pivot to meet critical needs as productivity and absenteeism shift unpredictably.
Secure, remote-friendly tools and flexibility in travel & expenses guidelines make employees’ lives easier and more productive as they work from home.
ServiceNow’s response seemed encouraging, and we wanted to see if it was consistent with the HR discipline as a whole, across the world.
So last week, we invited thousands of HR leaders to take part in a five-minute survey asking them for their take on current events, and what was working well and less well in their organizations.
As the pulse data shows, HR organization’s response has fallen into four important areas: physical health and wellbeing, followed very closely by remote work, and then quickly followed by issues related to jobs and work continuity and finally an urgent need for mental health, resilience, family support, and dealing with uncertainty.
It’s amazing that before this crisis, fewer than 50% of companies even had a remote work program.
Banks, regulated industries, and many financial services companies did not let employees work from home.
Today companies like Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and others are rushing to build remote work strategies.
(Hence our launch of the Remote Work Bootcamp this week.)
Note also how many companies are already focused on “job movement” and protection of jobs.
The Food Industry Association, for example, has started a massive program to help companies in all aspects of foodservice and delivery realign their people toward new jobs and roles.
Accenture is developing a similar program with the help of Verizon, Lincoln Financial, and ServiceNow.
As soon as plants and restaurants and locations were shut down, companies started to think about moving people to new roles.
One of the other issues top of mind is “continuity of operations.”
Novartis and other pharma companies were explicitly clear that the “crisis response” team is not the sole job of HR even at a time like this.
ServiceNow and many other companies are continuing to hire, and in fact ServiceNow shared with me today that it onboarded 45 people last week via Zoom.
Our survey does suggest this is the exception, rather than the rule; only 5% of HR Professionals anticipated their organization increasing its workforce in the wake of COVID.
Employee Issues
We then asked HR professionals to tell us “what’s on the minds of your employees?”
Unsurprisingly, the #1 issue is job security.
As demonstrated by the more than 6 million people filing for U.S. unemployment, people are immensely concerned about their pay and their jobs.
Right behind job security is health and wellbeing, followed then by family issues and finally, employees’ ability to do their jobs.
It’s interesting that financial issues are so much higher than anything else, probably driven by unemployment numbers, uncertainty in the financial markets, and no clear end to the health crisis.
Certainly, health is a big issue, but note that family health and productivity also score high.
Many of the HR leaders I interviewed this week told me that “making family life easier” is one of their biggest and most immediate goals because employees working at home are often also taking care of kids, monitoring schoolwork, and helping parents and other family members.
Companies are now surveying their employees to see who is impacted by these situations so they can relax work hours or add flexibility.
One executive told us her company has rated employees “essential” and “non-essential” and started a policy that all “essential” roles would not be eligible for vacation.
Non-essential employees were asked to take as much vacation as they could, since the company knew its business was slowing down and many of these people would have more time at home anyway.
Note that the issues of social isolation, mental health, personal finance, and stress scored high.
These are issues that were problematic prior to the crisis, but now they’re urgent.
Companies are hiring online coaches, counselors, and giving people as much open support as they can right now.
What Programs Have Been Most Successful?
We asked companies “what is working” and you can see there are a lot of things.
Most of these programs are focused on communication, remote work, and ongoing health and wellbeing.
Note also that more than 70% of companies are readjusting their HR priorities.
What Have Companies Learned – What Is Hard To do
We also asked “what are some of the challenges you faced?”
As you can see, they fall into the areas of coordination, integrated communication, and rapid response.
Many HR teams are not designed for agility; rather they are designed as service delivery functions.
In this world, HR teams have to immediately create response teams and quickly empower local business partners to act locally with global coordination.
As you can see from this data, local control and authority is a key to crisis response.
The military has learned that distributed autonomy with central coordination is the model that wins wars.
HR departments are figuring this out quickly.
What Does All This Mean?
We will publish this pulse every week in the coming weeks, so please tell us your experience.
But the takeaways from this first survey are clear.
In today’s world of Black Swan events, HR teams have to:
Focus on people first, economics second.
Develop rapid response teams that cross organizational boundaries.
Distribute authority to remote HR professionals, and coordinate action quickly.
Create real-time data collection to identify precisely where problems are occurring.
Rapidly develop programs to educate, train, and empower people to work at home.
Relax rules for hours, pay, and vacation to respond to fast-changing conditions.
Quickly assess what jobs are going away and start to align people toward new roles quickly.
Stay positive and communicate a positive growth spirit despite the uncertainty and change.
Re-Frame Employee Experience: Focus On Real-Time Action
One of the most important HR capabilities being tested is agility.
HR departments must build a crisis response muscle, learn quickly how to distribute authority and coordinate activity, and implement real-time data collection, listening, and communication programs.
We’ve been working on EX programs quite intensely for the last few years.
Now is the time to make this all matter.
Please take our brief survey and contribute to next week’s pulse.
Thank you.
Some 15% of home broadband users in the United States say they have had trouble paying for their high-speed internet service during the coronavirus outbreak.
That includes 34% of those with household incomes of less than $30,000 a year, according to a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults conducted Jan. 25-Feb. 8, 2021.
While the pandemic took a notable toll on the finances of Americans with lower incomes, some broadband users in households earning more have also struggled to pay for this service.
A quarter of home broadband users with annual household incomes ranging from $30,000 to just under $50,000 say they have had trouble doing so in the pandemic, as have roughly one-in-ten (8%) with household incomes ranging from $50,000 to $74,999.
There are also differences by Americans’ educational attainment.
Some 22% of broadband users who have a high school diploma or less have had trouble paying for this service.
A similar share (16%) of those who have some college education, but do not have a degree, say the same.
By comparison, a smaller share of college graduates (8%) have had trouble paying for high-speed internet service.
How we did this To better understand the role of the internet in Americans’ lives during the coronavirus pandemic, Pew Research Center surveyed 1,502 U.S. adults from Jan. 25 to Feb. 8, 2021, by cellphone and landline phone.
The survey was conducted by interviewers under the direction of Abt Associates and is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, education and other categories.
Here are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and its methodology.
Many Americans also report difficulty paying for other kinds of connectivity – like cellphone service and cable or satellite television – during COVID-19, with similar differences by income and education.
Some 15% of smartphone owners say they have had trouble paying for their cellphone service during the pandemic.
That includes 36% in households earning less than $30,000 annually and 24% in households earning $30,000 to $49,999.
These percentages are nearly identical when it comes to cable or satellite television services.
Overall, 16% of cable or satellite TV subscribers have had difficulty paying for these services during the outbreak, as have 37% of those in households earning less than $30,000 a year and 24% in households earning between $30,000 and $49,999 a year.
Among those who are “smartphone dependent” for their internet connectivity – that is, people who own a smartphone, but do not subscribe to broadband at home – 27% say they have had trouble paying for their cellphone service amid COVID-19.
Previous Pew Research Center studies have shown that Americans with lower incomes and less formal education are especially likely to be smartphone dependent in this way.
These new findings come amid efforts by the federal government to make emergency broadband funds available for Americans with lower incomes and establish programs to help close the “homework gap.”
Overall, about a quarter of Americans without a broadband connection at home (23%) cite financial constraints as one of the most important reasons why they forgo these services, according to separate survey findings released today by the Center.
Americans see a variety of disadvantages for those who lack home broadband access
The internet has played an important, even essential role in many Americans’ lives during the pandemic.
But there continue to be digital divides, including those related to affordability.
The Center’s latest survey on the topic shows that many Americans think not having home broadband puts people at a disadvantage during the pandemic.
But there are some differences in the specific ways they think this disadvantage plays out.
Overall, majorities of U.S. adults say people without high-speed internet at home are at a major disadvantage during the pandemic when it comes to getting schoolwork done (77%) and looking for jobs (66%).
Smaller shares say those who lack access are at a major disadvantage when it comes to connecting with doctors or other medical professionals (52%), staying in contact with friends and family (45%), and keeping up with the latest information about COVID-19 (43%).
There are striking differences in these views between broadband users and those who don’t have it.
For instance, 83% of home broadband users say people who don’t have it are at a major disadvantage in getting schoolwork done during the pandemic, and 70% say the same about looking for jobs.
Among those who don’t have broadband at home, smaller but still notable shares say lacking it is a major disadvantage when it comes to schoolwork (58%) or job searching (51%).
Home broadband users are also much more likely than non-users to see major disadvantages when it comes to keeping up with information about COVID-19 (21 percentage points), staying in contact with friends and family (15 points) and connecting with doctors or other medical professionals (13 points).
Americans’ views on these questions also vary by age and race and ethnicity.
Adults ages 18 to 49 are far more likely than those 65 and older to say that lacking high-speed internet access at home puts people at a major disadvantage during the pandemic in each of the five ways explored in the survey – with differences of roughly 20 percentage points or more between the two groups.
For example, about three-quarters (73%) of adults ages 18 to 49 say lacking high-speed internet at home puts people at a major disadvantage in looking for jobs, compared with half of those 65 and older.
And 83% of adults ages 18 to 49 say this about getting schoolwork done, versus a smaller share of Americans 65 and older (61%).
On some of these questions, but not all, there are also differences by race and ethnicity.
Black adults, for example, are more likely than White adults to say not having home broadband access puts people at a major disadvantage in connecting with doctors or other medical professionals (63% vs. 49%) and keeping up with information about the pandemic (53% vs. 42%).
The shares of Hispanic adults who see these as major disadvantages do not statistically differ from those of other racial and ethnic groups.
Separate survey findings recently released by the Center found that Hispanic (65%) and Black adults (71%) are less likely than White adults (80%) to have broadband at home.
(In that survey, as well as the new analysis, there were not enough Asian American respondents in the sample to be broken out separately.
As always, their responses are incorporated into the general population figures reported throughout this analysis.)
Note: Here are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and its methodology.
In a recent study published in the journal Nature Cardiovascular Research, a group of researchers determined whether Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) directly infects coronary vessels and atherosclerotic plaques to understand its role in inducing plaque inflammation.
They assessed its contribution to acute cardiovascular complications and increased long-term cardiovascular risk in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Silent Cardiovascular Threat of COVID-19
COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, exhibits varied symptoms, ranging from none to severe respiratory distress and multi-organ failure, sometimes leading to death.
A significant concern is the heightened risk of cardiovascular events like heart attack and stroke, persisting up to a year post-infection, markedly more than in cases of influenza.
These events are typically linked to the inflammation of arterial plaque.
Analysis of autopsy specimens revealed that the virus infects infiltrating macrophages within coronary vessels, particularly lipid-laden ones, inducing substantial pro-atherogenic inflammatory responses.
This suggests a direct link between the virus and observed cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 patients.
Further research is crucial to comprehend these interactions thoroughly, fostering the development of targeted interventions to diminish long-term cardiovascular risks in survivors.
Unraveling COVID’s Heart Connection
The present study strictly conformed to ethical standards, examining autopsy specimens from eight COVID-19 patients to investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) in coronary macrophages, utilizing advanced methodologies such as RNAscope in situ hybridization and spatial artificial intelligence (AI).
The findings disclosed the presence and replication of viral RNA in each section analyzed, highlighting an increased susceptibility of coronary macrophages to the virus, notably in Pathological Intimal Thickening (PIT).
This implies an elevated risk of cardiovascular complications in those infected.
In the study, scientists quantified infectious particles using plaque assays and explored the impact of silencing Neuropilin-1(NRP1) in human macrophages and foam cells, utilizing advanced molecular biology techniques.
Sophisticated protein quantification, Western blot analysis, and Reverse Transcription Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT–qPCR) were employed to elucidate the intricate interplay of cellular and viral components.
Rigorous RNA-seq data processing, analysis, and visualization were undertaken to understand the nuances of gene expression, and cytokine secretion was assessed to study immune responses.
Transmission electron microscopy was utilized to examine infected atherosclerotic samples in detail.
The study implemented rigorous statistical analyses, with significant results highlighting the multi-faceted interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and cellular structures, pointing to critical insights into the pathogenesis of the virus and potential therapeutic targets.
The comprehensive approach in methodology and analysis underscores the thoroughness and significance of the research in understanding the implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cells.
Why COVID-19 is a Game-Changer for Heart Health
The study uncovered pivotal data about the susceptibilities of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and macrophages to SARS-CoV-2, showing a higher vulnerability in macrophages.
The research disclosed that both macrophages and foam cells, which are associated with atherosclerosis, could host the virus.
Notably, foam cells demonstrated more susceptibility and a slower virus clearance process.
Infected macrophages had heightened interferon responses, enabling quicker viral clearance, while foam cells revealed modified lipid metabolism routes, potentially aiding viral entry and replication.
A deeper study of the Type I Interferon (IFN-I) response underscored kinetic disparities in IFN response and SARS-CoV-2 gene expression between macrophages and foam cells.
The results imply that enduring IFN response in macrophages may lead to diminished viral persistence, while the decline in IFN-I score in foam cells affects the infection and replication processes of SARS-CoV-2, showcasing the varying responses and impacts on different cell types.
Investigation into the inflammatory profiles of infected macrophages and foam cells revealed secretion of pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic cytokines such as Interleukin 6 ( IL-6) and IL-1β, intensifying ischemic cardiovascular risks.
A unique release of IL-18 and IFN-α2 by infected macrophages and foam cells, respectively, were identified, indicating differential inflammatory reactions to viral infection.
Additionally, the study illustrated how SARS-CoV-2 can intensify inflammation within atherosclerotic lesions by infecting human atherosclerotic vascular explants, highlighting the possible increase in ischemic cardiovascular events in individuals with pre-existing atherosclerosis.
An examination of various arteries disclosed high expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors and factors in myeloid subclusters, with NRP1 being predominant in Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (TREM2+) macrophages, suggesting its crucial role in mediating infection within the atherosclerotic vasculature.
Elevated numbers of NRP1+ macrophages expressing the antisense strand of the S gene in PIT lesions were detected, confirming the increased susceptibility of these lesions to infection.
Pathways to Therapeutic Breakthroughs
The thorough exploration, utilizing silencing RNA to inhibit NRP-1 expression, provided profound insights into its significant impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection and unveiled the nuanced inflammatory and viral response dynamics within various cell types and vascular tissues.
These revelations are paramount in understanding the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and the host and open new possibilities for therapeutic interventions targeting vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis in the context of COVID-19, reinforcing the importance of understanding the direct impact of the virus on cardiovascular tissues, particularly in individuals with existing cardiovascular conditions.
This research is foundational for developing strategies to mitigate cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 patients.
I got my first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine on Dec. 16, and was surprised at the feeling of relief, hope, almost exhilaration it brought on instantly.
It was an unexpectedly emotional experience.
It’s been more than two weeks since my second jab so I am, in theory, pretty well immune to Covid-19.
Shielded behind an N95, visor, gown, and gloves, I reckon I’m now about as safe as I can be.
So when my day’s work as an anesthesiologist is done, I’ve started sitting with Covid-19 patients.
At first I tried chatting with them, but when someone is breathing 30 times a minute through an oxygen mask, it’s difficult to be a great conversationalist.
Now I talk to them, hold a hand, get them water, arrange their pillows.
Sometimes I just sit there because I have this nagging, incompletely explored belief that just a human presence, someone bearing witness to their ordeal, has value.
Afterward, I call the family because they are victims of this virus too.
advertisement
I also realize that, as much as this is about patients, it’s about me, too.
I’ve put breathing tubes into enough Covid-19 patients who went on to die that I’m a little punch drunk.
And the insidious tedium of the Covid-19 world with its constant petty annoyances — mask wearing, sanitizing, backing away from people — and the profusion of well-meaning but misguided rules is taking a mental and emotional toll on me.
Sitting with patients lets me push back against a virus that affects almost every aspect of my day.
Dying alone behind closed hospital doors
My wanting to sit and talk with Covid-19 patients stems from what happened to a patient during my first job as a junior doctor in England.
Its memory follows me today.
We were caring for an old, old gentleman during his last days.
We were doing what we could to keep him alive so his son in Australia could fly back and see him before he died.
advertisement
At the time, British hospitals kept patients in bays of four or six beds, a vestige of the huge Nightingale wards of the Victorian infirmaries.
But as my patient neared the end of his life, he had been moved to a single-bed side room.
One morning as I came in to round on my patients, a nurse took me aside to tell me that my patient had died during the night, before his son’s flight had arrived.
That was tragic, but the full story was far sadder.
As is common in people nearing death, my patient apparently became agitated and tried to climb over the bed rail.
In doing so, he fell to the floor.
Anyone who has worked in a hospital or nursing home knows the sickening sound of an old person falling: a faint cry, the scrape of a grasped nightstand, the horrible thwack of failing limbs and an undefended skull meeting hard floor.
But, of course, the only thing worse than hearing a fall is not hearing it.
Behind a closed door, my patient lay on the ground for perhaps hours — no one exactly knew — until he was found by a nurse during the morning medication round.
Distraught, she called for help.
They put him back into the bed, where he died a short time later.
There are so many things about his death that still make me angry and upset.
But my overriding feeling was this: If we can’t offer a dying man something better than passing his last hours on this planet alone, crumpled on a cold hospital floor, then we might as well all pack up and go home.
Fast forward to 2021 in the Massachusetts hospital I work in, but it could be any hospital in the U.S.
When I’m on call and all my duties are done, I walk through the hospital to get my head around the Covid-19 pandemic.
In the operating rooms, where I spend most of my time, all patients are Covid-free.
It is on the medical floors that you see signs of the pandemic: countless shelves of bagged PPE for the next shift, nurses in N95s, and closed doors — rows and rows of closed doors.
Behind every door, a person with Covid-19.
Alone.
We treat them with the few tools we have in our armamentarium — antiviral drugs, the steroid dexamethasone, oxygen — and we wait.
They see their nurse periodically.
A food service worker comes in three times a day with a tray of food.
Other than that, no human contact.
Throughout the pandemic, interacting with all patients, not just those with Covid-19, has been difficult; more so since the November surge began and hospitals once again stopped allowing visitors.
And because going into a room housing a Covid-19-positive patient requires putting on an N95 mask, a secondary mask, and a full-face visor — along with a gown and gloves, which must be changed between rooms — health care providers keep visits to these patients to a minimum.
Behind each closed door is a patient: breathless, exhausted, often confused, perhaps scared, always alone.
Behind each patient is a family, also confused and scared, and unable to visit their loved one.
This heartbreaking scenario is replicated behind countless closed doors in almost every hospital across the country.
The implications of immunity
2020 was a dreadful year and 2021 has started off even worse.
But those of us who have been vaccinated have a rare opportunity, a privilege, perhaps even a moral duty, to use our immunity to connect with patients, to connect with families, to bear witness.
It allows us to regain some control over a seemingly uncontrollable situation.
We can gain agency and rediscover the reason so many of us went into medicine in the first place.
So I’m asking anyone who has been vaccinated to think hard about what your newfound immunity represents.
One thing it means is that being physically present with people who have Covid-19 is possible again.
We need an army of vaccinated volunteers to support patients and be a conduit for their families, to help them through the worst days — sometimes the last days — of their lives.
This can’t come from way up in the hospital hierarchy.
After all, any act of true altruism is the preserve of the individual, not the hospital system.
It must come from the nurses, doctors, cleaners, technicians, and others who want to dedicate a few minutes at the start and end of their shifts to human contact.
If we can’t hold the hand of a dying person in their last hours on this planet, we might as well all pack up and go home.

Editor’s Note: This brief was updated on March 10, 2023 to reflect recent price announcements by Moderna and the release of the President’s FY 2024 budget request.
The federal government has spent more than $30 billion on COVID-19 vaccines, including the new bivalent boosters, incentivizing their development, guaranteeing a market, and ensuring that these vaccines would be provided free of charge to the U.S. population.
However, last year, the Biden Administration announced that it no longer had funding, absent further Congressional action, to make additional purchases and it began preparing for the transition of COVID-19 vaccines to the commercial market.
This means that manufacturers will be negotiating prices directly with insurers and purchasers, not just the federal government, and prices are expected to rise.
Elsewhere, we have analyzed the implications of commercialization for access to and coverage of COVID-19 vaccines, finding that most, but not all, people will still have free access.
Still, the cost of purchasing vaccines for the population is likely to rise on a per dose basis, though the extent to which it affects total health spending is dependent on vaccine uptake and any negotiated discounts, among other factors.
Here, we illustrate the potential total cost of Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, based on their publicly-announced expected prices, once they enter the U.S. commercial market.
Specifically, we compare the average price paid by the federal government for the COVID-19 bivalent boosters to the estimated average commercial prices that have been suggested by manufacturers, and calculate an overall cost for purchasing vaccines for the adult population (ages 18 and older) across different scenarios of vaccine uptake (we only estimate costs for purchasing a single vaccine dose under different population uptake scenarios though it is possible that additional boosters will be needed on an annual or some other regular basis).
While four COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized or approved for use in the United States, we focus our analysis only on Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which account for almost all doses administered in the U.S. (97% as of March 2 ) and approximately 80% of all federal funding spent on COVID-19 vaccines.
The federal government has so far purchased 1.2 billion doses of Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines combined, at a cost of $25.3 billion, or a weighted average purchase price of $20.69 per dose.
In mid-2020, months before any COVID-19 vaccine was yet authorized or had even completed clinical trials, the federal government purchased an initial 200 million vaccine doses from Pfizer and Moderna (100 million each), at a price of $19.50 per dose and $15.25 per dose, respectively.
This guaranteed an advance market for these vaccines, should they prove safe and effective and receive emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as each did in December 2020.
In total, the federal government has made six different bulk purchases from Pfizer, totaling 655 million doses, and five bulk purchases from Moderna, totaling 566 million doses, for a total of 1.2 billion doses.
Subsequent federal government purchases were made at a higher price per dose, with a weighted average across these purchases of $20.69.
(See Figure 1 below and Tables in Appendix.)
The federal price paid per dose has generally increased over time, with the highest price paid for the most recent bivalent, or updated, boosters.
The most expensive price per dose paid by the government was for the recent purchase of bivalent booster doses from each manufacturer, including 105 million doses at $30.48 per dose from Pfizer and 66 million doses at $26.36 per dose from Moderna (or a weighted average price per dose of $28.89).
This represented a 56% increase in the price per dose for Pfizer, compared to the initial Pfizer purchase price, and a 73% increase for Moderna.
In total, the U.S. has purchased 171 million doses of the bivalent booster at a cost of $4.9 billion.
While the commercial prices for COVID-19 vaccines are not yet known, both Pfizer and Moderna have signaled likely ranges that are three to four times greater than the pre-purchased federal price for the bivalent booster.
In a recent investor call, Pfizer indicated that it expected a commercial price per dose for its vaccine to be between $110 and $130.
Moderna has also suggested the same range.
This range is 4 to almost 5 times greater than the weighted average price per dose paid by the federal government for Moderna and Pfizer bivalent doses ($28.90).
In the unlikely outer bound scenario in which all adults were to receive a vaccine at the announced expected commercial prices, it could cost between $28.4 billion and $33.5 billion to purchase enough vaccine doses for the U.S. adult population for a one-year period (258 million doses).
The lower end of this cost range ($28.4 billion for 258 million doses) is several billion higher than what the federal government has spent for more than four times as many Pfizer and Moderna doses to date ($25.3 billion for 1.2 billion doses).
See Figure 2.
Even under much lower vaccine uptake scenarios (e.g., 50% of adults getting a booster), the total cost to purchase COVID vaccines at the commercial price would still exceed the cost of purchasing enough vaccines for everyone at the federal bivalent booster price.
Under a scenario where half of the adult population is vaccinated for COVID-19 at the announced commercial prices-per-dose, the total cost (ranging from $14.2 billion to $16.8 billion) still greatly exceeds the cost of purchasing vaccines for all adults at the average federal bivalent price ($7.5 billion).
Although all adults are recommended to get the Omicron booster, a 50% uptake rate would be similar to that of the annual flu vaccine.
If only a quarter of the adult population were to be boosted at the commercial price per dose, the total cost could range from $7.1 billion to $8.4 billion.
The low end of that range is slightly lower than the cost of vaccinating all adults at the federal price.
Current take-up of the Omicron booster – at 19.6% of all adults as of March 2– is even lower, though these boosters only became available last September and there are continuing efforts to encourage people to get boosted.
KFF’s latest COVID-19 vaccine monitor survey found that just under a third of adults who had not yet had an updated booster said they planned to get one as soon as they could.
While most people will still be able to get COVID-19 vaccines for free, these costs will be borne by both public and private vaccine payers.
As we have described in an earlier analysis, most people with health insurance will still be able to get COVID-19 vaccines, including boosters, for free even after the federally purchased supplies are depleted.
But these costs will still be borne by public and private payers.
In addition, the cost estimates we provide above are only for the vaccine doses themselves; there is also the cost of vaccine administration which could range from about $25 to $40 per dose, as well as a potential physician visit fee.
For insured people, these costs would be covered by the insurer, as they are currently.
Thus far, about four in ten adults who have received an updated booster dose are over age 65 and likely covered by Medicare, while the remaining two thirds are likely primarily covered by either Medicaid or private insurance.
As older adults are more likely to opt for booster shots, a disproportionate share of the total national spending may be borne by the Medicare program.
(For most preventive vaccines, Medicare pays 95% of the average wholesale price, which is often referred to as the “list” price, but we do not account for this potential modest discount in our cost illustrations above.)
For private insurers and their enrollees, these costs are expected to have an upward effect on premiums.
Our recent analysis of 2023 premium filings from ACA Marketplace insurers found that some insurers say the end to federal purchasing could have a small upward effect on premiums next year.
These costs could continue to push premiums upward in future years as well, particularly if private insurers under-estimated the cost of the vaccine dose before Pfizer and Moderna’s price announcements.
For the uninsured and underinsured – who will not have guaranteed access to free COVID-19 vaccines – the commercial price could discourage vaccination.
The suggested average price for COVID-19 vaccines after commercialization ($110 to $130 per dose) is significantly higher than the commercial price for the annual flu vaccine ($18 to 30 per dose), and could be a cost barrier for the uninsured and underinsured, who have no guaranteed mechanism for receiving COVID-19 (or any) vaccines once federal supplies are depleted.
This includes people with private insurance in grandfathered or short-term limited duration health plans, as these are not subject to the Affordable Care Act’s requirement to provide recommended vaccines with no out-of-pocket cost.
These individuals could have to pay all or some of the cost of the vaccine and associated physician appointments or administration fees.
To provide enough COVID-19 vaccines for the 23.4 million uninsured adults in the U.S. at commercial prices for a one-year period excluding administration costs would cost between $2.6 billion and $3 billion; at the average federal price paid for the bivalent booster, it would cost $677 million.
(The total cost would be higher if extended to the under-insured).
To address the lack of guaranteed access to vaccines for uninsured adults, in last year’s budget request, the Biden administration proposed creating a new “Vaccines for Adults” (VFA) program to provide uninsured adults with access to all ACIP-recommended vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, at no cost, although Congress did not act on that proposal.
The administration has once again included the proposal in its FY 2024 budget request.
In addition, both Moderna and Pfizer have indicated that they will use patient assistance programs to provide free COVID-19 vaccines to the uninsured and underinsured but details on those programs are not yet available.
Discussion
On a per-dose basis, the cost to continue to vaccinate adults in the U.S. against COVID-19 after federally purchased doses are depleted is likely to be significantly higher than the costs borne in the past by the federal government.
Here, we find that the commercial price ranges announced by Moderna and Pfizer are four to almost five times greater than the pre-purchased federal price for the bivalent booster, resulting in comparatively high total costs even if, for example, only half the population were to get boosted.
At the same time, it is important to note that even at higher spending levels driven by commercial pricing, COVID-19 vaccination is likely to be cost-effective compared to not vaccinating, given the effectiveness of these vaccines at preventing hospitalizations and deaths.
While most consumers with public and private insurance will be protected from having to pay directly for vaccine costs, those who are uninsured and underinsured may face cost barriers when the federally-purchased vaccine doses are depleted.
In addition, as private payers take on more of the cost of vaccinations and boosters, this could have a small upward effect on health insurance premiums.
Many of the factors that will influence the future commercial market and the exact price of COVID-19 vaccine doses are hard to predict at this point.
Here, we illustrated the cost of a purchasing a single vaccine dose under different population uptake scenarios, but it’s possible that doses could be needed more frequently if new variants arrive, or less frequently if the pandemic wanes.
Costs will also depend greatly on the number of people that elect to be vaccinated, and booster uptake is low so far.
Ultimately, the price for future doses is hard to know, and they could be higher than those implied by companies so far if new formulations are developed, or could come down if discounts are negotiated.
Still, insurers and public programs will not have much leverage since they are generally required to cover all ACIP recommended COVID vaccines with no patient out-of-pocket cost.
Without advanced purchases or guarantees by the federal government, it’s also possible that future supply may not always match demand, which would have unpredictable consequences for the price and availability of vaccines in the U.S.

As Covid and flu hospitalizations have climbed in the weeks since Thanksgiving, White House's Covid-19 coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said families will be safer at upcoming holiday gatherings if they get their updated vaccines.
This year, hospitals are facing the simultaneous threat of Covid, flu and RSV for the first time.
Circulation of flu and RSV was very low during the pandemic due to widespread masking and social distancing implemented in response to Covid, but as most people return to normal life, all three viruses are circulating widely.
As of Dec. 14, the 7-day average of weekly new Covid cases reached 65,067, a 2.9% decrease from the previous week, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
"The good news here is that we can prevent those infections from turning into serious illness if people go out and get that updated bivalent vaccine," Jha told ABC's "This Week" Sunday.
Public health officials have said many people are probably more vulnerable to flu and RSV this year because they weren't infected in the past two years, which means their immunity is lower.
Around 23,503 patients were admitted to the hospital with influenza this week, the CDC reported, while RSV hospitalizations appear to have peaked in some states.
Hospitalizations of people with Covid topped more than 5,000 per day on average, according to the CDC.
Former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said it's going to be a "difficult few weeks," and he told CBS News' "Face the Nation" Sunday that this year's respiratory pathogen season is the "worst in recent memory.
"
Gottlieb said it has been a historic year for the flu in particular.
"80% of hospital beds right now are full.
The hospitals haven't been this full since the peak of the omicron wave last winter," he said.
"The difference is that last winter, 25% of those hospital beds were filled with Covid admissions.
Right now, only 6% are filled with Covid admissions.
"
Even though it is safe to gather in groups this year, Jha said staying up to date on vaccines will be essential for keeping people out of the hospital.
"I got my flu shot last year.
I don't expect that to protect me this winter," he said.
"I go out and get my flu shot every winter, in the same way people have to go out and get their Covid shot."
Five months after being infected with the coronavirus, Nicole Murphy’s pulse rate is going berserk.
Normally in the 70s, which is ideal, it has been jumping to 160, 170 and sometimes 210 beats per minute even when she is at rest — putting her at risk of a heart attack, heart failure or stroke.
Question:
Are blood clots and/or heart problems potential side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines?
Answer from infectious diseases expert James Lawler, MD:
Multiple studies and data from vaccine safety monitoring systems show the COVID-19 vaccines are as safe as other routine vaccines.
As with any vaccine, rare adverse events have been reported after COVID-19 vaccination.
For example, some people who received the Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines reported blood clots.
The condition is known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome or TTS.
Out of more than 18 million people who got J&J vaccines in the U.S., 60 cases of TTS were reported, and nine people died.
Most people who developed these problems were female, ages 18 to 49.
For women, the risk of blood clots after the J&J vaccine is estimated to be 5.8 per million.
For men, the risk of blood clots after J&J is 2.2 per million.
It is important to put this risk in context.
The overall risk of an unvaccinated person dying from a COVID-19 infection is much higher than the risk of clots from the Johnson & Johnson or AstraZeneca vaccines.
To date, the U.S. has recorded roughly 48,000,000 COVID cases and almost 68,000 deaths in persons 18 to 49 years old.
Even if we assume actual infection numbers are much higher, the risk of dying from a COVID-19 infection is hundreds of times more than the risk of blood clots from these vaccines.
Studies also show that the incidence of blood clots in people with COVID-19 infection is much higher than in the general population and much higher than the incidence with vaccines.
No evidence indicates that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are associated with the same risk of blood clots.
However, data from multiple studies show a slight risk for myocarditis and pericarditis following the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.
These cases occurred most frequently in males, ages 16 years and older, within seven days of receiving the second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.
Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle.
Pericarditis is inflammation of the lining outside the heart.
Most cases are mild, with symptoms resolving within a few days.
However, severe cases can lead to abnormal heart rhythm, stroke, heart attack or death.
As with blood clots, the incidence of severe myocarditis and pericarditis is MUCH higher in persons who are infected with COVID-19.
The COVID-19 virus can damage multiple organs, including:
• Brain
• Heart
• Lungs
This can lead to severe neurological, heart and other long-term health complications.
Therefore, the benefits far outweigh the risks of receiving the COVID-19 vaccines.
In fact, data consistently show that mortality rates are much lower in vaccinated and boosted individuals compared to those who have never been vaccinated or boosted.
As of the latest available data in the U.S. (October 2022), unvaccinated persons were 29 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than those who were vaccinated with an updated booster.

The delta variant is a strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the delta variant was first identified in India in December 2020, and it was detected in the United States in March 2021.
By the end of July, it became the dominant variant in the U.S. More than 80% of new COVID cases are attributed to the delta variant, and severe cases are primarily among unvaccinated people.
The Delta Variant Is More Contagious
The delta variant is highly transmissible compared to earlier COVID variants.
A recent study out of the United Kingdom found a 64% increase in the odds of transmission associated with the delta variant compared to the alpha variant, the previously dominant COVID variant.
Viruses are constantly changing, and new variants will differ in terms of how quickly a virus will spread, how sick people will get from it and how resistant it will be to treatment or vaccines.
New variants of viruses occur when a virus attaches to a new host cell and undergoes genetic mutations as it replicates.
“Often, mutations are of little consequence to the behavior of the virus, but sometimes a mutation will cause it to become more ‘fit,’” said Joyce Sanchez, MD, Froedtert & MCW infectious disease specialist and director of the Froedtert & MCW Travel Health Clinic.
“A mutation can make the virus more contagious, allow it to replicate more readily in our cells or survive in the environment for longer periods of time.
The delta variant is one strain that has become more fit by being more transmissible than the ancestral strain.”
Delta Variant Symptoms Are the Same as Earlier COVID Variants
COVID symptoms associated with the delta variant have not changed in a considerable way since the original strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
The virus presents with a wide range of flu-like symptoms.
The most common COVID symptoms are:
Fever
Cough
Shortness of breath
Fatigue
Muscle aches
Headache
Sore throat
Congestion or runny nose
“Loss of taste and smell is another common and distinguishing feature, though some studies suggest there may be less cough and loss of taste and smell with the delta variant compared to the ancestral strain,” Dr. Sanchez said.
“Also, some patients may have infection and be asymptomatic; in other words, they do not present with any symptoms.”
Unvaccinated People Are Most at Risk
Anyone who has not recently recovered from COVID-19 or been fully vaccinated is more at risk for developing infection from the delta variant, particularly in communities where transmission rates are high and when public health precautions are not taken.
Risk factors for severe disease, hospitalization and death include older age (ages 65 and over), obesity and medical problems such as diabetes, heart disease, lung disease or immunosuppression.
In August 2021, vaccine data from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) showed just over half of Wisconsinites were fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
According to DHS, more than 98% of COVID cases in Wisconsin between January 2021 and the end of July 2021 were among people who were not fully vaccinated.
COVID Vaccines Are Effective Against the Delta Variant
Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from COVID-19.
According to the CDC, all three COVID vaccines offer protection from the delta variant.
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is one dose, and the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are both a series of two doses.
The CDC recommends that people whose immune systems are compromised receive a third dose (booster) of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in August 2021 for individuals ages 16 and over.
The Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are approved by the FDA for emergency use.
The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are messenger RNA vaccines — also known as mRNA vaccines — that deliver a small piece of genetic code from the virus that causes COVID-19 to infect your cells, showing your body how to mount an immune response and produce antibodies against it.
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses an adenovirus, a common virus that causes cold-like symptoms, containing information about the virus that causes COVID-19 to instruct your immune system on how to protect against a COVID infection.
According to the FDA, the agency responsible for evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the COVID vaccines, people who have been vaccinated are at a significantly lower risk of developing infection, including mild or severe disease and death due to COVID-19.
This is because a fully vaccinated person’s immune system is primed to recognize the virus and kill it before it has time to replicate and cause disease.
“The original studies from 2020 showed that the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines were more than 90% effective against infection and nearly 100% effective in preventing hospitalization and death.
Even with the more contagious delta variant, to date, the available vaccines have demonstrated to still be very effective in preventing infection, especially for severe disease and death,” Dr. Sanchez said.
Vaccine manufacturers continue to investigate whether those who have been fully vaccinated have measurable immune responses against variants as they arise.
The CDC cites a study published in July 2021 in the New England Journal of Medicine that looked at the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines against the delta variant.
Researchers found only a modest difference in effectiveness compared to the original alpha variant.
Breakthrough Infections Are Usually Asymptomatic
A breakthrough infection is a term used to describe an infection that occurs in a person who has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
While the COVID vaccines are highly effective, no vaccine is 100% effective at delivering immunity.
“Breakthrough infections are generally asymptomatic or symptoms are mild,” Dr. Sanchez said.
“These cases are inevitable when people are living in communities with high rates of transmission and where a large proportion of people are not immune, either through vaccination or recent recovery from infection.
"
Breakthrough infections are usually detected when screenings take place for travel, sports or employment purposes.
Most people who experience a breakthrough infection report mild or no symptoms.
Cases of severe disease, hospitalization and death in fully vaccinated individuals are extremely rare, and the risk is dramatically lower than in those who have not been fully vaccinated.
It’s Rare, But Vaccinated People Can Spread COVID-19
The small proportion of fully vaccinated people who experience a delta variant breakthrough infection can spread the virus to others, according to the CDC.
This became clear after CDC outbreak investigations, including the July 2021 outbreak in Massachusetts.
The CDC recommends everyone wear a mask indoors in public settings in areas of substantial or high transmission, regardless of vaccination status.
This map shows the level of community transmission in your area.
The CDC says there is an increased amount of virus, also known as viral load, produced by the delta variant compared with earlier COVID variants.
Preliminary research indicates both unvaccinated and fully vaccinated people produce the same amount of virus once infected.
However, fully vaccinated people are likely infectious for less time.
COVID-19 Can Have Long-Term Effects
People who had COVID-19 and recovered can experience health problems months later.
Organ damage (particularly to the lungs, heart and brain) and autoimmune conditions are post-COVID conditions that people who survived severe COVID infections may experience.
But, even young, healthy individuals who experienced mild disease or people who had minimal or no symptoms while they were infected can develop more long-term effects, known as Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID (PASC), also called “long-COVID,” “long-haul COVID,” “chronic COVID” or “post-acute COVID-19.”
“Several symptoms, including chronic fatigue, memory problems and brain fog can last weeks to months and interfere with a person’s ability to live as they did previously,” Dr. Sanchez said.
Post-COVID conditions typically present four or more weeks after infection.
The CDC and other infectious disease experts are studying post-COVID conditions to learn more about who is at risk and why.
Froedtert & MCW patients experiencing COVID symptoms eight or more weeks after diagnosis are eligible for treatment through the Froedtert & MCW Post-COVID Multispecialty Clinic.
Interested patients should discuss their symptoms with their Froedtert & MCW provider.
The Bottom Line: Vaccination Is the Best Protection and Prevention Against the Delta Variant
Being fully vaccinated:
Protects you from the virus
Lessens severity of disease if infected
Protects those who are not yet eligible to get vaccinated (children under the age of 12)
Protects those who may not be able to mount a robust immune response to the vaccines (immunocompromised people)
Prevents the virus from replicating and potentially mutating, leading to more variants
There is still a lot to learn about the delta variant, including if it causes more severe disease in nonimmune individuals, including young, healthy people.
At this time, the data is mixed.
Although uncommon, researchers are also studying how often breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated people occur and how fully vaccinated people can spread COVID-19 to others.
Research is also underway regarding booster vaccines to determine if they will be needed in the future due to new variants, waning immunity or both and whether certain individuals (such as the elderly or immunocompromised) may develop waning immunity faster than others.

New Global Dashboard on COVID-19 Vaccine Equity finds low-income countries would add $38 billion to their GDP forecast for 2021 if they had the same vaccination rate as high-income countries.
Global economic recovery at risk if vaccines are not equitably manufactured, scaled up and distributed.
COVID-19 vaccine inequity will have a lasting and profound impact on socio-economic recovery in low- and lower-middle income countries without urgent action to boost supply and assure equitable access for every country, including through dose sharing, according to new data released today by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the University of Oxford.
An acceleration in scaling up manufacturing and sharing enough vaccine doses with low-income countries could have added $38 billion to their GDP forecast for 2021 if they had similar vaccination rates as high income countries.
At a time when richer countries have paid trillions in stimulus to prop up flagging economies, now is the moment to ensure vaccine doses are shared quickly, all barriers to increasing vaccine manufacturing are removed and financing support is secured so vaccines are distributed equitably and a truly global economic recovery can take place.
A high price per COVID-19 vaccine dose relative to other vaccines and delivery costs – including for the health workforce surge – could put a huge strain on fragile health systems and undermine routine immunization and essential health services and could cause alarming spikes in measles, pneumonia and diarrhea.
There is also a clear risk in terms of foregone opportunities for the expansion of other immunization services, for example the safe and effective rollout of HPV vaccines.
Lower income countries need timely access to sustainably priced vaccines and timely financial support.
These insights come from the Global Dashboard for COVID-19 Vaccine Equity, a joint initiative from UNDP, WHO and the University of Oxford’s Blavatnik School of Government, which combines the latest information on COVID-19 vaccination with the most recent socio-economic data to illustrate why accelerating vaccine equity is not only critical to saving lives but also to driving a faster and fairer recovery from the pandemic with benefits for all.
“In some low- and middle-income countries, less than 1 per cent of the population is vaccinated – this is contributing to a two-track recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic”, said UNDP Administrator, Achim Steiner.
“It’s time for swift, collective action – this new COVID-19 Vaccine Equity Dashboard will provide Governments, policymakers and international organisations with unique insights to accelerate the global delivery of vaccines and mitigate the devastating socio-economic impacts of the pandemic.”
According to the new Dashboard, which builds on data from multiple entities including the IMF, World Bank, UNICEF and Gavi, and analysis on per capita GDP growth rates from the World Economic Outlook, richer countries are projected to vaccinate quicker and recover economically quicker from COVID-19, while poorer countries haven’t even been able to vaccinate their health workers and most at-risk population and may not achieve pre-COVID-19 levels of growth until 2024.
Meanwhile, Delta and other variants are driving some countries to reinstate strict public health social measures.
This is further worsening the social, economic and health impact, especially for the most vulnerable and marginalised people.
Vaccine inequity threatens all countries and risks reversing hard won progress on the Sustainable Development Goals.
“Vaccine inequity is the world’s biggest obstacle to ending this pandemic and recovering from COVID-19,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization.
“Economically, epidemiologically and morally, it is in all countries' best interest to use the latest available data to make lifesaving vaccines available to all.”
Designed to empower policy makers and development partners to take urgent action to reduce vaccine inequity, the Global Dashboard breaks down the impact of accessibility against a target for countries to vaccinate their at-risk populations first to reduce mortality and protect the health system and then move on to vaccinating larger shares of the population to reduce disease burden and re-open socio-economic activity.
The Dashboard is facilitated by the Global Action Plan for Healthy Lives and Well-being for All (SDG3 GAP), which aims to improve collaboration across the multilateral system to support an equitable and resilient recovery from the pandemic and drive progress towards the health-related SDGs.

A large study today from Germany shows that kids and adolescents are at the same relative risk of experiencing COVID-19 symptoms 90 days or more after acute infection as adults are, according to findings in PLOS Medicine.
And a new systematic review by researchers from the World Health Organization (WHO) in the same journal shows that likely two thirds of the world's population has SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
About a third of kids, adults have long COVID
Though kids and adolescents have far fewer deaths or severe outcomes from COVID-19 infections compared to adults, little is known about long or post COVID symptoms in this age-group, or symptoms that persist for more than 12 weeks after acute infection.
Researchers from the Technical University of Dresden, Germany, used data from half of the German population to determine that kids and adults have the same relative risk of experiencing post COVID symptoms at 90 days following infection.
The study was based on medical records of those with COVID-19 infections confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing in all of 2020 in Germany.
The authors compared the occurrence of pre-specified diagnoses, entered into the medical record at least 3 months post-infection, in COVID-19 patients to a control cohort of more than 750,000 people with matched age, sex and pre-existing medical conditions, without PCR-confirmed COVID-19.
The COVID group included 11,950 children and adolescents—67% of whom were younger than 12—and 145,184 adults aged 18 or older.
Kids and teens with COVID were 30% more likely than controls to have documented health problems 3 months or more after COVID-19 infection than COVID-negative controls (436.91 vs 335.98 per 1,000 person-years; incident rate ratio [IRR], 1.30; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 1.25 to 1.35; P < 0.01).
Adults with COVID-19, by comparison, were 33% more likely than controls to have health problems in the same timeframe (615.82 vs 464.15 per 1,000 person-years; IRR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.31 to 1.34, P < 0.01).
Kids' symptoms can differ from adults'
Martin Roessler, PhD, the lead author of the study, said there were significant symptom overlap among kids and adults who experienced symptoms 90 days or more after acute infection.
"We found five identical outcomes among the 10 outcomes with the highest relative risk among children/adolescents and adults.
These symptoms are cough, fever, headache, malaise/fatigue/exhaustion, throat or chest pain," he told CIDRAP News.
Other symptoms were more commonly seen in adults, but not kids.
Those included a loss of taste or smell, fever, and shortness of breath.
'Kids tend to get better'
Daniel Blatt, MD, a pediatric infectious disease physician at the post-COVID clinic at Norton Children's Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky, said he was not surprised by the study's findings.
"It's unclear if long COVID is the same in children and adults, in terms of pathophysiology, but it's just as real," Blatt said.
Blatt, who was not involved in the study, said his clinic also collects data on children and long COVID.
He said the most common symptoms reported in his patients are fatigue, anxiety, and "brain fog," followed by some shortness of breath or muscle pain.
"The good news is kids tend to get better, regardless of what intervention is needed," Blatt said.
As in adult long COVID, there's no one-size-fits-all approach for pediatric long COVID patients.
"Some need reassurance; some need a graduated exercise program.
"
Blatt said for all pediatric long COVID cases, families need to be heard that what their child is experiencing is real and serious.
Globally, two-thirds have evidence of infection, vaccination
In a new meta-analysis of seroprevalence studies, WHO researchers and their colleagues from around the world identified 965 seroprevalence studies—those testing for antibodies in the blood—that collectively included 5,346,069 participants between January 2020 and April 2022.
Among the studies, 43% were from low- to middle-income countries.
By September of 2021, 59.2% of the global population were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 either from infection or vaccination (95% CI, 56.1% to 62.2%), "suggesting two-thirds of the global population may be SARS-CoV-2 seropositive from either vaccination or infection," according to a PLOS news release.
In contrast, seroprevalence was just 7.7% in June of 2020.
"Our study provides updated estimates into 2022 and over time, which was able to highlight much steeper increases in seroprevalence due to vaccination in some regions and infection in others," said Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesperson from the WHO, in an email.
Jasarevic also said the WHO study looked at seroprevalence by region, with high-income countries in the Americas and Europe having over 90% seroprevalence by early 2022.
Jasarevic said some of the biggest jumps in those regions came during the Omicron wave of last winter.
"Our results show that seroprevalence has increased considerably over time, particularly from late 2021, due to mainly infection in some regions and vaccination in others," the authors concluded.
"Nevertheless there is regional variation and over one-third of the global population are seronegative to the SARS-CoV-2 virus."
Women who are looking to schedule their annual mammogram might want to make that appointment before getting their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.
For some women, routine mammograms are showing swollen lymph nodes in the upper arm and armpit area on the side where they’ve received their vaccine.
But that’s not a reason to be alarmed, says Marie Quinn, MD, MPH, former Director of Breast Imaging in the Diagnostic Radiology Department at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center.
Swollen lymph nodes are an indication that your body is doing what it’s supposed to, responding to the vaccine and making antibodies, Dr. Quinn says.
It also isn’t a response unique to the COVID-19 vaccine, as it has been seen on occasion in people who have received other vaccines, including the annual flu shot and the shingles vaccine.
Lymph nodes can remain swollen for up to 12 weeks, but for most women, any swelling would be reduced between four and six weeks after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, she says.
“We’re currently recommending that women schedule their mammogram for four to six weeks after their second dose,” Dr. Quinn says.
“If you’ve had your first dose of the vaccine and you’re due for a mammogram, schedule it for four weeks after the second dose.
But if you’re having a breast-related issue, such as a mass, do not wait to schedule your screening.”
If swelling is noticed during a mammogram and a woman has had a first or second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine within the past month or so, she will be asked to come in for a breast ultrasound within six to eight weeks to make sure the swelling has reduced.
“Lymph nodes are a normal structure in your body that filter your blood.
That’s where your immune cells mature,” Dr. Quinn says.
“Anything that’s going on in your body — whether that’s having a vaccine or a rash, or bug bites and sunburn in the summer or dry skin in the winter — it affects your lymph nodes.”
Lymph nodes usually look like kidney beans, she says, and when they’re swollen, the outer area, called the cortex, looks fatter than normal, causing the nodes to look more rounded, like grapes.
When the swelling goes down, the lymph nodes go back to looking like kidney beans, all of which can be observed on mammograms, breast MRIs and ultrasounds.

“Feeling swollen lymph nodes after a vaccine is a normal response,” she says.
But because these lymph nodes closest to the vaccine injection site are also important in terms of breast cancer detection, additional imaging is done to ensure confidence in the mammogram findings.
“If you want to decrease your risk of us seeing swollen lymph nodes, come in before you’ve had the vaccine or four to six weeks after you’ve had the second dose,” Dr. Quinn says.
The mammography team at Roswell Park has been screening women safely for breast cancer and conducting diagnostic screenings since May 2020, when the pandemic was hitting an early peak, she says.
The staff at the clinic have been vaccinated against the virus and continue to practice all recommended safety precautions, including wearing masks and regularly sanitizing the equipment and areas where patients wait for their appointments.
Port-au-Prince, 17th July 2021 ---
Following the delivery of 500,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine donated by the United States through the COVAX mechanism, a first vaccination session was organized on Friday, July 16 by the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP) at the Hospital Universitaire de Paix (HUP) in Port-au-Prince, where many health professionals and elderly people came to receive the first dose of Moderna vaccine.
Solange Février, a cleaning lady at HUP, is among the first Haitians to be vaccinated in the country.
"I work at the hospital, I am happy and it is a very good thing for the country.
Moreover, after receiving my first dose, I feel very good," she explains.

"This first vaccination session went well overall.
The doses arrived at HUP in the early afternoon and by 2:45 pm, 38 people had already been vaccinated," explained Dr. Edmond Gue, Vaccination Program Officer at the PAHO/WHO office in Haiti, who came to observe the session.
Other vaccination centers should gradually open this weekend and during the next week in Port-au-Prince and its region, and then extend to the 10 departments of the country.
This donation of 500,000 through the COVAX mechanism is part of the U.S. government's efforts to increase COVID-19 coverage in other countries around the world, to counter new waves of infection, and to prioritize the vaccination of health care workers and other vulnerable populations in neighboring countries in need of vaccines.
The U.S. government has committed to donating approximately 12 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to countries in the Caribbean and Latin America.
To date, nearly 26 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been delivered to 31 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean through COVAX.
However, only about 14% of the total population of the Caribbean and Latin America is fully vaccinated, and some countries have not yet been able to vaccinate more than 1% of their population.
Until vaccination is widespread among the population in Haiti and the region, public health measures remain the basis of the response to the pandemic.
For public health authorities, this means continued screening, contact tracing, isolation, assisted quarantine and quality care.
And for individuals, it means continuing to practice physical distancing, hand hygiene, use of masks, ventilation of spaces and avoidance of crowds.

Patients with severe COVID-19 produce antibodies that paradoxically shut down their immune system’s virus-fighting response just when they need it most, according to new UC San Francisco research published in Nature.
Scientists believe this overzealous antibody response is an inappropriate engagement of an ancient biological feedback circuit whose real function is to help the body tamp down levels of immune signaling molecules called interferons, to modulate the immune response once a viral infection is under control.
Interferons help to stop a cell’s protein-making machinery, so viruses can’t hijack it to make copies of themselves.
But in patients with severe COVID-19, antibodies that block the effects of interferons appear prematurely, removing the cells’ defenses while the infection is still raging.
The antibodies lock onto a cell surface protein called CD32b, which functions as a primal “off” switch for interferons.
By closely examining immune cell populations in 21 patients, researchers found that severe patients – whom they defined as those needing mechanical ventilation or intensive care in the hospital – were unable to produce a line of interferon-stimulated immune cells that were abundant in the patients who had mild or moderate disease.
To further demonstrate that it was really the antibody blockade of the surface receptor that was preventing the formation of these protective interferon-stimulated cells, the researchers bathed healthy immune cells in serum containing antibodies from the severe patients.
The healthy immune cells promptly lost their ability to respond to interferon, either partially or completely.
But when the scientists removed the antibodies from the serum, the healthy immune cells were once again able to normally differentiate into the interferon-stimulated immune cells.
Likewise, when they blocked the CD32b receptor to prevent the antibodies from turning off the interferon signaling circuit, the cells were able to respond to interferons.
This is not the first study to implicate interferons in severe COVID-19 disease.
Previous research demonstrated that 12 percent of severe patients have an autoimmune reaction against their own interferons, which also neutralizes it.
The UCSF research shows how the remaining 88 percent of severe COVID-19 patients may be experiencing a different, more global immune breakdown that also involves antibodies made by their immune system in its attempt to control the virus.
Scientists said the discovery of this mechanism of severe disease opens up new approaches to developing therapies that could prevent it.
“What we’re learning here is how to address the mistakes of the immune system with immunotherapy,” said Matthew “Max” Krummel, PhD, an immunologist and professor in the UCSF Department of Pathology who led the effort with colleagues at UCSF’s Bakar ImmunoX Initiative, CoLabs and the COMET Consortium.
“It’s another way to handle the immune system.
Rather than pre-educating it with a vaccine, you prevent the immune system from going off the rails after a person gets infected.”

Krummel, whose work usually focuses on the immune system off-switches that are targeted by the cancer immunotherapy agents called checkpoint inhibitors, said a similar approach also could be taken to combat the worst effects of both COVID and other viral infections.
“An immunotherapy for a pandemic would be a breakthrough in how we drug a pathogen,” he said.
“You don’t just target the pathogen, but instead change how the immune system responds to it – just like we did for cancer.”
The faulty mechanism could be targeted with existing antibody treatments, like the arthritis drug rituximab or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which is used to treat antibody deficiencies.
The UCSF group said it’s also possible to create a “designer antibody” to deal with the problem.
A therapy to prevent severe viral disease could provide a stopgap measure to offset the dire need for vaccines in the current pandemic, and it would dramatically change the calculus of how society responds to future emerging viral threats.
“If we knew we had drugs to keep severe conditions from occurring – if the worst was in fact a lowly, one-week flu-like experience – imagine how different the world would be today,” Krummel said.

COVID’s closure of clinics and doctors’ offices opened new doors online, and some trans and nonbinary patients were able to receive gender-affirming care for the first time thanks to new telehealth providers and online clinics.
The looming end of the official COVID Public Health Emergency means some of those doors could be closing.
“Many people in this country live in care deserts,” said Kate Steinle, chief clinical officer at FOLX Health, an LGBTQ+ startup that launched during the pandemic.
“That’s care deserts from any provider, and specifically care deserts from an affirming provider, somebody who knows how to address the health concerns of the LGBT population.”
Companies like FOLX and its competitor Plume, which ship hormones directly to patients, have rapidly expanded in the past three years.
But easily accessible testosterone prescriptions over the platforms could be coming to an end.
On May 11, the federal government’s COVID-19 Public Health Emergency will expire, ending a number of pandemic-relief rules, including a waiver that allowed doctors practicing medicine online to prescribe testosterone to patients without meeting in person.
On Wednesday, the DEA announced it would extend telemedicine waivers in response to an unprecedented 38,000 comments about the expiration.
It remains unclear if or when the rule will expire, but LGBTQ+ health advocates say the extension will be life-saving for many who are dependent on telemedicine for testosterone.
“Any rule that requires any type of evaluation in person of trans and gender-diverse individuals will result in significant harm, because we’ll see access to gender-affirming care decline,” said Dallas Ducar, CEO of TransHealth, a Massachusetts-based transgender clinic.
“And any physical requirement also increases [the] risk of potential violence or even discrimination.”
Under the current proposed rule by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), patients taking testosterone will need to meet with a licensed DEA doctor in person within six months if they want to stay on testosterone through telehealth.
New testosterone prescriptions will also require in-person visits.
The expiration does not affect the hormone estrogen.
Historically used by athletes in the late 80s and early 90s to enhance performance, testosterone has been classified as a controlled substance by the federal government.
Controlled substances are medications that are tightly monitored by the DEA because they are more likely than other drugs to be abused or cause addiction.
The classification of testosterone has long been a subject of ire for transgender health experts.
Today, some say it makes getting the hormone to people who need it for transgender care particularly tricky.
Ducar said many have pushed for testosterone to be declassified as a controlled substance for gender-affirming care.
In September 2022, Sens. Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren asked the Biden administration to reconsider the classification of testosterone.
A spokesperson for Markey said his office has yet to get a response on that request.
“As the public health emergency declaration winds down, we cannot allow the critical tools that were developed to connect patients to care to sunset along with it,” Markey said in a statement to The 19th.
“I have repeatedly urged the administration to expand, not roll back, gender and life-affirming care for trans people.”
The DEA did not respond to a request from The 19th to comment for this story.
It’s unclear just how many people could lose access to testosterone if the waiver expires.
Current data on transgender and nonbinary people is scarce, but the 2015 transgender survey conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality found that while 78 percent of transgender people wanted hormone therapy, just 49 percent had received it.
A third of those surveyed — 33 percent — said they had experienced discrimination from a health care provider in the last year.
Companies like FOLX and Plume aimed to open up access to the more than half of gender-diverse people looking for other options.
Plume currently serves 13,000 people, according to the company.
FOLX has 12,000 patients.
Both companies estimate that fewer than half of their members use the platforms to get testosterone.
An untold number of doctors and companies also moved their gender-affirming practices online during the pandemic.
Those providers are scrambling to find in-person appointments for patients before November of this year when the six-month grace period ends.
FOLX Health sent an email to its members instructing them to trek to the closest Planned Parenthood clinic for in-person appointments.
Plume has instructed its clients to lobby the federal government to change the proposed rules before May 11.
Advocacy organizations like the National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE) and the Human Rights Campaign have been pushing the Biden administration to allow those companies to continue seeing patients online or allow lab visits, which are required for hormone prescriptions to count as in-person appointments.
TransHealth had also sent staff members to Washington D.C., to meet with lawmakers, hoping that the final rules ease restrictions on testosterone.
“We’re particularly concerned about people in rural areas and states where we’ve seen attempts to prohibit access to care,” C.P. Hoffman, senior policy counsel at NCTE, said.
The expiration of the waiver raises alarm bells about the future of transgender health companies that built their business models on temporary pandemic health rules.
Both FOLX and Plume were conceived before COVID hit, but former employees and health care experts at the companies say both startups anticipated the public health expiration and declined to plan for it.
On March 17, FOLX laid off 15 staffers out of 100 contract and full-time employees in anticipation of the rule.
Steinle said the company is not at risk of folding but needed to downsize in anticipation of a cooler climate for venture startups as the economy begins to drag.
Three former FOLX employees, who were unwilling to be named due to non-disclosure agreements with the company, said that as early as 2020, transgender employees pitched the idea of mobile clinics so that testosterone users would not lose access when the public health emergency ended.
“It was mind-boggling for me to witness the company be like, ‘OK, it’s temporary, but we’re gonna go ahead and expand our services for this,’ knowing that it was a risk in the long term that we could lose half of our, you know, our members,” said one former employee.
Steinle said the company hoped that in providing critical care to transgender people, it would also be able to present irrefutable data that might make the temporary waiver permanent.
“The government then allowing us to do this through telehealth now that we can have many years of use cases showing that it is good, and safe and literally clinically the same as doing it in person could then influence the continuation of that afterwards.”
Steinle said.
Dr. Jerrica Kirkley, co-founder and chief medical officer at Plume, acknowledged that the decision to expand access to testosterone under a temporary rule was tricky.
She doesn’t necessarily regret it.
“When we get into marginalized communities, who face significant limitations and access to basic civil rights and health care, we often talk about a risk-reduction model,” Kirkley said.
“And so there I would say that maximizing the opportunities that we have to provide life-saving care is critical, and we’ve got to take every opportunity we can.
At the same time . . .
be responsible in that sense of contingency planning.”
