Health officials have long wondered how many people who get COVID-19 show no symptoms.
Because those who don't feel sick rarely get tested, experts have only been able to estimate the number of such asymptomatic cases.
But new research now shows more than 40% of those who tested positive for COVID-19 were asymptomatic, according to the study published Tuesday in JAMA Network Open.
Researchers looked at 95 studies from January 2020 to February 2021 consisting of nearly 30 million people in Asia, Europe, North America, South America and Africa.
More than 60% of confirmed COVID-19 cases among people under 20 were asymptomatic; nearly 50% in people 20 to 39; about 32% in people 40 to 59, and about 33% in those over 60.
“Across the board, it showed that among the elderly, two-thirds had symptoms, and among the 20- to 30-year-olds, about two-thirds didn’t have symptoms,” said Dr. Alan Wells, medical director of UPMC Clinical Laboratories and professor of pathology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, who is not affiliated with the study.
“That’s what we see in a lot of respiratory viruses.”
The study also showed the highest number of asymptomatic cases occurred in nursing home residents or staff, air or cruise travelers and pregnant women.
That doesn’t mean those populations were more susceptible to asymptomatic infections, Wells said, just that they were more likely to be tested.
Nursing home staff and residents underwent frequent testing throughout the pandemic, international aircrafts and cruise ships required a negative test before boarding and pregnant women were tested at every doctor’s appointment.
“If we had a more comprehensive testing program that sampled everyone in an unbiased way, we would pick up more (asymptomatic cases),” Wells said.
While 40% of COVID-19 infections overall were asymptomatic, they represented only .25% of the tested population.
But health experts say it’s still a cause for concern.
It’s also likely an underestimation as testing was not widely available in many countries during the study’s timeframe.
“A quarter of a percent of the tested population ending asymptomatic, that doesn’t seem like a very large amount,” said Mark Cameron, infectious disease immunologist as Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.
“However, when you multiply that by the hundreds of millions of people around the world, that’s a significant amount of people transmitting the virus that’s falling through the cracks.”

The proportion of asymptomatic cases among confirmed cases of COVID-19 is also worrisome as previous studies found such people may not be as protected against reinfection compared to those who have moderate symptoms, Cameron said.
The Kentucky Department for Public Health and a local health department investigated two outbreaks at a nursing facility, one in July 2020 and the second in October 2020.
Researchers found five residents – three asymptomatic and two with mild symptoms during the first outbreak – were more sick during the second outbreak, according to the study published in February 2021 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“They’re still studying this issue but the data has congealed around a hypothesis that the more severe illness, the higher your level of neutralizing antibodies and lasting immunity,” Cameron said.
“Asymptomatic and mild infections lead to less robust immune responses.”
It's likely more COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic today compared to when the study was conducted, health experts say, due to highly transmissible variants like delta and omicron.
Vaccines themselves may also contribute to a higher proportion of asymptomatic infections, Wells said, as they’re extremely effective against severe disease and mute the symptoms of a breakthrough infection.
The best protection against COVID-19 remains getting a vaccine and booster, said Dr. Shiv Pillai, immunologist and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
"No one is not getting protected from infection, but it's not very long lasting," he said.
"It's always better to get vaccinated.

'Covid toes' that turn purple from the disease can last for at least five months after survivors beat the infection, scientists have found.
Inflammation of the toes caused by Covid-19 can lead to red or purple skin, swelling and chilblain-like blisters.
The symptom typically develops within a week of getting infected and goes naturally within a fortnight.
But in some people, the skin problem has become a manifestation of 'Long Covid', lasting for months after patients have fought the virus off.
Dermatologists who conducted the research fear the cases they have seen are 'just the tip of the iceberg', and that it is in fact a common presentation of the virus.
Previous research estimates that around one in 12 people with coronavirus develop some kind of skin complaint, and experts have repeatedly called for health chiefs to recognise it as an official symptom.
'Covid toes' that turn purple from the disease can least for five months after infection, scientists have found
Inflammation of the toes caused by Covid-19 can lead to red or purple skin, swelling and chilblain-like blisters
The latest study was conducted by researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).
Scientists established an international registry for Covid-19 skin manifestations in April 2020, in collaboration with the International League of Dermatological Societies and the American Academy of Dermatology.
Doctors who entered patients into the register in April were contacted in June and August to update the duration of patients' Covid-19 skin symptoms.
Almost 1,000 cases of patients with skin manifestations of Covid-19 in 39 countries were recorded.
About half of the patients in the registry were reported to have Covid toes and about 16 per cent of those had to be hospitalised from the disease, figures showed.
HOW DOES COVID AFFECT YOUR TOES?
'Covid toes' is just one of many skin manifestations reported in patients.
Dr Esther Freeman, principal investigator of the International Covid-19 Dermatology Registry, said: 'The skin can be viewed as a window into the rest of the body because it is inflammation which you can see - and can be indicative of inflammation elsewhere.'
Dr Faheem Latheef, a consultant dermatologist and skin allergy specialist, said normally skin symptoms are caused by the body's immune system, not the virus itself.
'The main reason is a hypersensitive immune reaction,' he told MailOnline in April.
'It's the body's reaction to something it perceives as foreign.'
Researchers at King's College London called for skin rashes to be considered as the fourth key symptom of Covid-19 in July, after a cough, fever and loss of taste and smell.
Using data from the COVID Symptom Study app from around 336,000 regular UK users, researchers discovered that 8.8 per cent of people reporting a positive coronavirus swab test had experienced a skin rash as part of their symptoms.
This compares with 5.4 per cent of people with a negative test result, showing it is more common in those who have the coronavirus and therefore must be caused by it.
Dr Adil Sheraz, a consultant dermatologist and spokesperson told MailOnline in April: 'A variety of skin manifestations have been seen in Covid-19 positive patients.
'However we are uncertain whether these are directly related to the virus itself or to the complications of the infection.
'If you develop a new rash then please speak to your GP or dermatologist.
Almost all dermatologists are offering virtual consultations and even face to face in urgent cases.
A diagnosis of Covid-19 should not be made from just the presence of a rash.'

Of those who had 'Covid toes' — which is chilblains, redness or swelling of the feet and hands — symptoms lasted for 10 to 15 days, on average.
But six patients were 'long haulers' with toe symptoms lasting at least 60 days.
Two patients saw the problem last longer than 130 days.
And one of the researchers warned some were still suffering from 'Covid toes' 150 days later — the equivalent of around five months.
The findings, which will be presented at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress in Switzerland this week, point to another burden experienced by so-called 'long haulers'.
Dr Esther Freeman, principal investigator of the International Covid-19 Dermatology Registry, said: 'It seems there is a certain sub-group of patients that, when they get Covid, they develop inflammation in their toes, which turns them red and swollen, and then they eventually turn purple.
'In most cases, it is self-resolved and it goes away.
It is relatively mild.
'It lasts on average about 15 days.
But we have seen patients lasting a month or two months.
'
She added: 'What is very surprising is when you get beyond that 60-day mark — because it's not like patients are resolving at day 70.
'It's the fact that some of our patients are at over 150 days now — these are patients with red or purple or swollen toes for many months.
'
Dr Freeman said the identification of people with Covid toes helps scientists understand more about coronavirus-related symptoms elsewhere in the body.
She said: 'We are starting to see long Covid in other organ systems, this is the first time we are recognising this can happen in the skin as well.
'I think it raises a lot of questions about what sort of inflammation is going on — is there inflammation elsewhere in the body?
'We don't really know the answer yet.
'The skin can be viewed as a window into the rest of the body because it is inflammation which you can see - and can be indicative of inflammation elsewhere.
'
The figures were submitted by doctors treating patients with skin issues in dozens of countries around the world.
Dr Freeman said: 'I think what we're reporting is probably just the tip of the iceberg - it's probably happening a lot more than we're reporting but I think by reporting it more people will recognise it.'
Researchers at King's College London called for skin rashes to be considered as the fourth key symptom of Covid-19 in July, after a cough, fever and loss of taste and smell.
Their research found characteristic skin rashes and 'Covid fingers and toes' can occur in the absence of any other symptoms and affects around 8.8 per cent of patients.
First lady Jill Biden tested positive for the coronavirus on Monday, at the end of a three-day weekend she had spent alongside President Biden , the White House said.
“This evening, the First Lady tested positive for COVID-19,” Jill Biden’s communications director Elizabeth Alexander said in a statement late Monday.
“She is currently experiencing only mild symptoms.
She will remain at their home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.”

Despite being two completely different illnesses, Covid and Lyme disease produce similar symptoms.
With tick season in swing, many may think their fever-like sickness is caused by Covid
Is it Covid or Lyme disease?
Key symptom to spot as infections cause similar signs
Much is known about the novel virus Covid causing a respiratory infection seen across the world.
But Lyme disease still remains a relatively little-known illness in the UK.
The disease is caused by being bitten by a parasitic tick, resulting in a number of similar symptoms to Covid.
Ticks are most active in the spring and summer months when the weather warms up, but can be found all year round.
Ticks that carry Lyme disease are found all over the UK.
High-risk areas include grassy and wooded areas found in both southern and northern England.
Lyme disease is said to have around 2,000 to 3,000 cases a year.

Symptoms of Lyme disease
Signs you may have been bitten by a tick and have early Lyme disease include:
Fever and chills
Headache
Fatigue
Muscle and joint aches
Swollen lymph nodes
Erythema migrans (EM) rash.
What is an E M rash?
Image: NHS WS) NHS WS)
EM is a rash that frequently appears as one of the first symptoms of Lyme disease.
This is the key difference between a Lyme disease infection and Covid.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an EM rash occurs in about 70 to 80% of all infected people at the site of the tick bite.
An EM rash appears as a “bulls-eye” appearance which is warm to the touch.
It is not usually itchy or painful.
Symptoms of Covid
Main symptoms warning of Covid include:
Fever or chills
Cough
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Fatigue
Muscle or body aches
Headache
New loss of taste or smell
Sore throat
Congestion or runny nose
Nausea or vomiting
Diarrhoea.
Main difference between Lyme disease and Covid
Immunologist Dr Purvi Parikh said: “The biggest difference is the site of entry into the body for both illnesses.
“Influenza, cold viruses, and coronavirus enter the body through the nasal passageways and lung tissues, so defining symptoms of these infections are most often respiratory.
“Tick-borne microbes, on the other hand, enter the body through the skin and bloodstream, so symptoms often include rashes and odd systematic symptoms.”

How to lower your risk of Lyme disease and Covid
According to the CDC, to avoid your risk of Lyme disease a person needs to:
Limit time spent in grassy, brushy or wooded areas
Wear long-sleeved shirts and trousers when in those type of areas
Use insect repellent to protect against the ticks.
For Covid, the CDC advises:
Limit close, person-to-person contact with those outside your immediate household
Wear face masks if in big crowds
Wash your hands regularly.
Respiratory symptoms are the classic marker of COVID-19.
But they are not the only indicators.
From the lungs to the heart, COVID-19 impacts our vital functioning in a profound manner, the effects of which, doctors worry can be experienced by patients long after the virus has vanished from the body.
One such devastating impact can be felt on core digestion and gastrointestinal functioning.
As of today, there's no one treatment for long COVID.
It's a complicated illness that can affect multiple areas of the body.
Many symptoms can come and go.
What's more, one person's long COVID course can look very different from another's.
Internal medicine physician Andrew Vasey, MD, sees a variety of long COVID patients in the Nebraska Medicine Post-Acute COVID Clinic.
Here Dr. Vasey shares some of the common symptoms that he and his medical colleagues see in clinic.
1.
Mood disorders
The COVID-19 illness itself or its effect on the body can cause mental health illness.
"People have developed depression and anxiety after their COVID-19 infection," says Dr. Vasey.
"For others, their preexisting mood disorder can get worse.
"
Some ICU survivors also experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
2.
Sleep issues
COVID-19 survivors may experience insomnia.
"Whether it's falling asleep or staying asleep, some aren't getting enough sleep.
We've also seen people with new-onset nightmares," says Dr. Vasey.
Sleep apnea can be seen as well, sometimes due to weight gain from the prolonged illness.
"Often we'll recommend a sleep study to see if someone is experiencing sleep apnea," says Dr. Vasey.
3.
Breathing problems
Breathing is normally an unconscious process – something you do without thinking.
Shortness of breath means you're consciously thinking about breathing and having difficulty doing so.
"Shortness of breath is a common issue seen in our clinic," says Dr. Vasey.
"Patients can experience shortness of breath after exertion or even at rest.
A persistent cough is also a common post- COVID symptom.
"
4.
Brain dysfunction, including brain fog
Brain fog (or trouble concentrating) is a common long-COVID symptom, and may persist for weeks or longer.
"Brain dysfunction after COVID-19 infection is quite common," says Thomas Scott Diesing, MD, Nebraska Medicine neurologist.
"Long-COVID symptoms can include inattention, cognitive troubles, fatigue, behavioral troubles and other neurological symptoms.
"
Less frequently, long COVID can cause chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).
5.
Heart issues
Long after someone's original infection, they may experience chest tightness or chest pain.
"We've had patients experiencing symptoms of chest pain/tightness or their heart racing over a year out from their original infection," says Dr. Vasey.
Heart issues can also contribute to the post-COVID symptoms of lightheadedness, dizziness and vertigo.
Myocarditis or heart inflammation can be seen after COVID-19 infection.
Importantly, myocarditis caused by the virus tends to be much more severe than myocarditis caused by the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
Viral myocarditis is also far more common than vaccine myocarditis.
See how post-COVID syndrome can affect your heart, explained by Nebraska Medicine cardiologist Daniel Anderson, MD, PhD.
COVID-19 survivors can also develop a cardiovascular condition called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).
A person with this syndrome has an unusually high heart rate after minimal activity, like standing up.
6.
Loss of taste or smell
One alarming symptom of post-COVID syndrome is the loss of taste and smell.
The vast majority of people recover their sense of smell in two or three weeks.
For a smaller percentage of patients, it may take months.
7. Hair loss
"Diffuse hair loss can surprise people in the months after their infection," says Dr. Vasey.
You normally lose hair in small amounts every day.
But during an infection, your hair follicles get overstimulated.
Then, all at once, many of the hair follicles go to a resting or shedding phase.
Hair loss can also happen with other types of infections when fevers are present.
8.
Skin rashes
Viruses can affect any part of the body where blood flows, so it's not surprising that it would affect the skin, which has the most blood vessels.
Skin rashes can include small bumps, discolored areas or blisters.
What is long COVID?
Some people recover from COVID-19 quickly, while others have unusual symptoms that last for months.
Long COVID is defined as having new or continued symptoms that persist more than 30 days after the original infection.
At this point, the cause of long COVID isn't clear.
"There are several working theories to explain why long COVID happens," explains Dr. Vasey.
"It's an area of ongoing research.
"
Several names for the condition also exist.
Long COVID can also be called:
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged to become a worldwide pandemic, infecting over 33 million globally, and now claiming more than 1 million lives.
It has also caused crippling socio-economic repercussions across the globe.
The symptoms of COVID-19 and their severity vary widely based on several factors.
Studies have shown that COVID-19 can lead to prolonged illness even in patients with mild symptoms.
Some reports suggest that symptoms may persist even after recovery and negative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results.
COVID-19 primarily targets the human respiratory system, with commonly reported symptoms, such as fever, shortness of breath, cough, muscle aches, fatigue, headache, sore throat, loss of smell (anosmia), or taste (ageusia/dysgeusia), nausea/vomiting, and congestion.
The order of appearance and duration of these symptoms or their severity have not been sufficiently explored yet.
Establishing a course of illness and being able to advise patients what to expect is crucial from a patient care standpoint.
It boosts the patients' ability to cope with the social, physical, mental, and financial challenges that arise with the disease.
Since the manifestation of COVID-19 is multifaceted, it requires longitudinal symptom characterization to help screening and disease management.
A preprint paper published on the medRxiv* server details a recent study by researchers from The Hebrew University, Hadassah-Hebrew University medical center, and Hadassah University Hospital, which addresses this gap in knowledge about the symptoms experienced by COVID-19 patients.
As part of this study performed in Israel during April and May 2020, the researchers conducted phone interviews and follow-ups with 112 adult COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms over 6 weeks.
The patients were aged ≥18 years with positive RT-PCR results.
Severely ill patients were excluded from this study.

Smell and taste changes lasted longer than other symptoms
The results of the study showed that nearly 70% of the study group experienced more than one symptom at the onset of disease.
More than 1/3rd of the patients presented with fever, headache, dry cough, or muscle ache as the first symptom.
In cases that reported fatigue, it was usually the first symptom noticed.
Changes in smell and taste occurred 3.9 ± 5.4 days and 4.6 ± 5.7 days (mean ± SD) from disease onset and were the first symptoms in 15 and 18% of patients, respectively.
Fever was the symptom that lasted for the shortest duration - 5.8 ± 8.6 days (mean ± SD), and smell and taste changes lasted the longest - 24.3 ± 22.9 days and 19.4 ± 19.1 (mean ± SD), respectively.
"We found COVID-19 illness to have a prolonged phase, in which symptoms such as fever, lack of appetite, headache and muscle aches are recovered, but dry cough, loss of taste, and loss of smell persist, with the latter having the longest duration of 24.3 ± 22.9 days (mean ± SD).
"
Longer duration of anosmia correlated with the severity of anosmia.
One-third of the patients who experienced cough, anosmia and taste changes had these symptoms even after they tested negative in RT-PCR tests.
Symptoms-related data can help predict recovery patterns
Based on the data collected from the study group, the team concluded that while many of the typical symptoms can occur first or last, some were more likely to be the first symptom.
Typically, during the onset, most patients reported more than one symptom.
The extent of olfactory changes is directly associated with time taken for smell recovery.
Lack of chemosensory recuperation in patients after recovery is also common.
The team hopes that the findings of their study may help in keeping patients informed about expected symptoms and recovery patterns at various stages of their illness.
"This information regarding their symptoms' durations and persistence post-recovery can potentially reduce anxiety and promote better management of patients' financial, social, and mental wellbeing during the disease.
"
Limitations of this study
The main limitation of this study is that it excluded severely ill patients, and is hence only relevant to COIVD-19 patients with mild to moderate illness.
All the data gathered were self-reported by the patients through a questionnaire, and objective testing was not performed as part of this study.
Moreover, this is a short duration study conducted for 6 weeks in the post-acute illness stage.
Given the importance of chemosensory disorders in COVID-19, the authors believe more extensive group studies, focusing on the order of appearance, duration, severity, and persistence of the symptoms, which extend over a more extended time period are essential to discovering additional manifestations of COVID-19.

Malinda Ann Hill decided to resume treatment for her eating disorder almost as soon as she shifted to working remotely in March 2020.
She knew even before the pandemic that isolation at home would be detrimental to her ongoing recovery from anorexia nervosa.
“I had made a really distinct decision not to work from home, so that sent me into a tailspin,” said Ms. Hill, 49, who lives with her daughter in Wynnewood, Pa., and works as an art therapist and bereavement coordinator for a local hospital.
The community and structure of her workplace were helpful for someone who had struggled with disordered eating since her early teens.
Sudden loneliness, mounting fears about the unfolding pandemic and a new lack of boundaries between work and home all helped tip off a relapse that Ms. Hill said had already been brewing.
“I thought maybe I should get back into treatment now,” she said.
“Because this is going to be bad.
And this is going to set off a lot of other people, too.”
Indeed, some doctors, therapists and dietitians who treat eating disorders, such as anorexia, bulimia and binge eating disorder, are reporting an overwhelming spike in the need for their services, with waiting lists growing at many practices and treatment centers across the country.
New Symptoms of COVID-19:
Blocked Nose And 2 Other Top Signs of COVID Infection
New Symptoms of COVID-19:
Blocked Nose And 2 Other Signs COVID Infected Patients May Notice
Here is a list of new COVID symptoms that was noticed among the ones who are infected with the mutated variants of COVID.
In the last couple of weeks, China has witnessed a massive surge in its daily COVID cases.
A report revealed that the country logged millions of cases on a single-day rise after the winter COVID wave, primarily driven by the new variants of the SARS-COV-2 causing COVID-19 infection entered Chinese provinces.
Two of the variants which are circulating in China, US, South Korea, and Japan are -- BF.7, and XBB.1.5.
These variants are not only driving new COVID surge in China and the United States but are also giving major challenges to others at high-risk countries by forcing them to brace for any unpredictable condition or sudden COVID outbreak in the upcoming days.
Top 3 Symptoms of COVID
At this time, one should know that the vaccines can provide enough immunity against the virus so that the patient doesn't suffer the severity of the infection.
However, it is important to note that the vaccine doesn't provide an individual from catching the virus, but it does provide immunity in the body that can fight the virus effectively.
Since infection can happen and symptoms can appear, here is a list of new COVID symptoms that was noticed among the ones who are infected with the mutated variants of COVID.
Sore Throat
One of the most dominant symptoms of COVID infection and also, the earliest sign to identify that you have contracted the virus is a sore throat.
This primarily happens due to the fact that the virus affects the respiratory system of the body, which comprises of nose, throat, lungs, etc.
After catching the virus infection, the patients may complain of feeling discomfort, pain, or scratchiness in their throats.
It can also lead to difficulty in swallowing your food.
But, the discomfort tends to improve each following day.
Runny Nose
One of the most common symptoms of COVID-19 infection is a runny nose.
According to the data, most of the patients catching the virus are reporting this one symptom in common.
How does it feel?
The patient may notice the free discharge of thin mucus from the nose.
Blocked Nose
A blocked nose, also known as nasal congestion is a condition wherein the blood vessels present inside the nose become inflamed with an excess amount of fluid.
This stuffy feeling inside the nose can occur with or without any discharge.

Other Common Symptoms of COVID-19
Apart from what is listed above, here is another list of common symptoms of coronavirus infection:
Sneezing Dry cough Chronic headache Wet cough with phlegm Hoarse voice Muscle aches and pains Loss of taste and smell High fever
Extreme fatigue
As per World Health Organisation (WHO), over 500 subvariants of the Omicron are currently circulating across the world.
So, it has become extremely difficult to identify whether you have contracted the virus relying on so-called 'classic' Covid symptoms.
Therefore, keep your eyes open, and make sure to visit a doctor as and when the COVID symptoms listed above appear.
Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms may be the only evidence of COVID-19 coronavirus in a certain subgroup of cases, researchers found.
A subgroup of patients may have digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, as their only symptom of COVID-19, with or without ever developing respiratory symptoms or even a fever, reported Xiaohua Hou, MD, PhD, of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, and colleagues.
Compared with patients with only respiratory symptoms, those with digestive symptoms were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 in their stool and have a longer delay until viral clearance, the authors wrote in a preprint appearing in the American Journal of Gastroenterology.
Moreover, they concluded that, when patients only present with new-onset GI symptoms and are a contact of a COVID-19 case, it may be reasonable to test them for the virus, even without any fever or respiratory symptoms.
"This study is vital because it represents the 80% or more of patients who do not have severe or critical disease.
This is about the more common scenario of people in the community struggling to figure out if they might have COVID-19 because of new-onset diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting," Brennan M.R. Spiegel, MD, the journal's co-editor-in-chief, said in a statement.
GI symptoms have been associated with COVID-19 infection, as they were with SARS, though they appeared to be isolated to a small subsection of patients.
However, experts have been urging gastroenterologists to consider COVID-19 in a differential diagnosis when a patient presents with both respiratory and GI symptoms.
This data seems to go beyond even that, saying COVID-19 should be suspected with GI symptoms in absence of respiratory symptoms.
"Because COVID-19 testing has largely focused on patients with respiratory symptoms -- not digestive symptoms -- it is possible there is a large cohort of undiagnosed patients with low severity illness but with digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, who unknowingly spread the virus," Hou and colleagues wrote.
They examined data from 206 patients from a single hospital, including 48 who only presented with a digestive symptom (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting), 69 who presented with both digestive and respiratory symptoms, and 89 with respiratory symptoms alone.
Patients were a mean age of 62, and 56% were women.
Interestingly, the digestive and respiratory group was more likely to report shortness of breath, fatigue, and muscle soreness versus the respiratory-only group.
Among the group who had GI symptoms, 67 had diarrhea, with an average duration of over 5 days, and a frequency of around four bowel movements per day.
They noted concurrent fever in 62% of patients with a digestive symptom, meaning almost 40% did not have fever.
Mean interval from symptom onset and viral clearance across groups was 38 days, with an average hospital stay of about 24 days.
However, the total time between symptom onset and viral clearance was significantly longer in the digestive-only and digestive and respiratory symptom group versus the respiratory-only group (40.9 vs 42.0 vs 33.5 days, respectively, P<0.001).
Likewise, Hou and colleagues found patients with coronavirus RNA in their stool had a significantly longer time to viral clearance than patients who tested negative in stool (44.2 vs 33.7 days, P=0.003).
Not surprisingly, those with digestive symptoms were more likely to have virus in their stool.
"The longer disease course in patients with digestive symptoms might reflect a higher viral burden in these patients in comparison to those with only respiratory symptoms," they wrote.
Limitations to the data include small sample size, inability to perform correlations between fecal virus RNA and severity of digestive symptoms, and the fact that the study does not confirm viral particles in stool are infectious and capable of disease transmission.
Further research is needed to determine if COVID-19 can be spread through the fecal-oral route.

Asymptomatic individuals carrying SARS-CoV-2 shed the virus longer than those with COVID-19 symptoms, with other lab findings suggesting the symptomatic patients mounted more robust immune responses, a small study in China found.
Median duration of viral shedding among 37 asymptomatic patients was 19 days (interquartile range 15-26; range 6-45) versus 14 days among 37 matched symptomatic patients (IQR 9-22; log-rank P=0.028), reported Jing-Fu Qiu, PhD, of Chongqing Medical University, and colleagues, though viral shedding does not necessarily mean the patients were infectious.
Virus-specific IgG antibody titers and cytokine levels were also significantly lower among asymptomatic patients in the acute phase of infection, when viral RNA can be found in respiratory specimens, the authors wrote in Nature Medicine -- both of which indicated that immune responses weren't as strong in the asymptomatic group.
Asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 is one of its biggest mysteries, with the World Health Organization recently reminding the public of the distinction between asymptomatic patients, who never develop symptoms, and presymptomatic patients, who go on to develop symptoms later in the course of disease.
Qiu and colleagues characterized asymptomatic carriers as the "silent spreaders" of COVID-19.
"However, our understanding of the clinical features and immune responses of asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection is limited," the researchers added.
For the study, they examined data from 178 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Wanzhou District in China, including 37 without symptoms.
Median age in the latter was 41, and 22 were women.
These individuals were matched by age, sex, and comorbidity with 37 symptomatic patients for antibody detection and cytokine measurement.
Qiu and colleagues also included a group of 37 individuals who tested negative via RT-PCR for cytokine comparisons.
Lab values and imaging were not entirely normal for the asymptomatic group.
Eleven had increased C-reactive protein levels and six had elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase.
Chest CT found "focal ground-glass opacities" in 11 and "stripe shadows and/or diffuse consolidation" in another 10 of the group; in two-thirds of these 21 patients, the abnormalities were in only one lung.
The remaining 16 showed entirely normal imaging.
Around 80% of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients tested positive for IgG antibodies about 3-4 weeks after exposure.
The difference was greater when examining IgM antibodies, with positive findings in 78.4% of symptomatic patients and 62.2% of asymptomatic patients.
In the early convalescent phase, defined as 8 weeks after hospital discharge, symptomatic patients had higher IgG levels, though both groups experienced over 90% decreases in IgG levels.
A larger proportion of asymptomatic patients had decreases in neutralizing serum antibody levels versus symptomatic patients (81.1% vs 62.2%, respectively).
These findings should serve as a caution against assuming prior infection confers immunity to future infection, Qiu and colleagues said.
"These data might indicate the risks of using COVID-19 'immunity passports' and support the prolongation of public health interventions, including social distancing, hygiene, isolation of high-risk groups, and widespread testing," the team wrote.
Plasma levels of cytokines were also similar between asymptomatic patients and healthy controls, though significantly higher levels of stem cell factor and leukemia inhibitory factor were found in the asymptomatic group, the researchers noted, calling this a "reduced inflammatory response characterized by low circulating concentrations of cytokines and chemokines.
"
Qiu and co-authors cited the varying sensitivity and specificity of antibody tests (obtained from a company called Bioscience) as a limitation to their study, adding that the results may be confounded by existing antibodies to other coronaviruses, such as SARS or MERS, as well as common cold viruses.

Canadians desperate to return home from abroad in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic are easily circumventing air travel screening aimed at preventing sick and infected passengers from boarding planes, CBC News has found.
Some are simply hiding symptoms from officials to ensure they can get back home.
CBC News has found a number of instances where sick travellers have boarded airplanes back to Canada, no matter the risks of spreading infection.
"Now is just the worst time to be coughing, sneezing or reporting any kind of symptom at an airport," said one university student in Toronto, who flew home from Spain on March 14.
She admitted she purposely hid her symptoms and the fact she'd been suffering a fever hours before boarding the flight.
"It wasn't information you volunteered.
So I just stayed quiet about it.
"
CBC has agreed to withhold her name to shield her from backlash, given that she travelled two days before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced anyone with symptoms would be barred from boarding return flights.
Further, she was only officially diagnosed with COVID-19 after she got home, and public health officials are now tracking all of her contacts.
WATCH | Canadian woman talks about decision to fly home despite feeling ill
'I stayed quiet about it' says sick traveller Duration 6:36 Sick air travellers hide COVID 19 symptoms to board flights home.
She said she wasn't sick when she bought her ticket, but developed a fever the day before her flight and took precautions to wear a mask and gloves on the plane to prevent the spread of any illness.
Although she didn't technically flout the rule set out by the government, her experience reflects that of many Canadians stuck abroad during the pandemic.
"My priority was just being able to get on the first flight back to Canada.
You know, no matter what the consequences were," she said, citing pressure from her university, the Canadian government and family, who all implored her to come home.
Her case demonstrates just how weak Canada's screening of air travellers is, given it relies solely on voluntary reporting of symptoms.
Even the "enhanced screening" adopted in recent days amounts to a simple series of health questions put to air travellers and does not involve any physical detection, testing or thermal screening now being used in many other countries.
Temptation 'to lie'
Jane Salhani of Aurora, Ont., which is north of Toronto, flew home from Munich on Sunday aboard an Air Canada flight where an obviously sick traveller had passengers and attendants on edge.
"This one woman, she was wearing a mask.
She coughed the entire nine hours.
I mean, everybody on that flight was extremely unnerved by it," Salhani told CBC News.
(Disclosure: Salhani is related to one of the authors of this article.)

Salhani recalled airline officials asking passengers whether they felt ill or had fever before boarding, but figured it isn't terribly effective in keeping sick people off planes.
"I'm sure the temptation is there to lie, because you want to get home to your own health system ...
if you're not feeling well, right?
You don't want to be stuck in a foreign country," she said.
Now at home in self-isolation with her husband, Salhani wondered whether airline and public health officials will be in touch about potential exposure.
She noted the sick passenger was taken aside and interviewed on arrival at Toronto's Pearson Airport, as all arriving passengers were handed pamphlets instructing them to self-isolate for 14 days.
"I'm sure we got on that plane healthy," Salhani said.
"I'm not sure we got off that plane healthy.
"
Reliance on honour system
The World Health Organization issued an advisory in mid-February calling on all countries to question all travellers about symptoms, and to implement "detection of ill travellers" at airports and border crossings to stem the COVID-19 outbreak.
Canada, facing criticism over a lack of screening both at international airports and upon arrival in Canada, imposed new orders to all airlines last Wednesday to prevent travellers with COVID-19 symptoms from boarding international flights to Canada.
But the "health check" imposed by Transport Canada — billed as "detection of ill travellers" — is a total honour system that simply requires airline staff to observe boarding passengers and ask them if they've felt ill or have had a fever.
Both Air Canada and WestJet said they have barred some passengers from boarding flights, but declined to say just how many.
CBC has spoken to many travellers who've recently returned to Canada who noticed the new questions posed when they boarded their flights home.

Eugene Haslam, who flew home to Montreal from Paris on Sunday on Air Transat, said the airline had signs, overhead announcements and staff asking questions before boarding.
But he acknowledged this approach will only work if travellers are honest.
He said that he understands the need to "act accordingly" and not put "others at risk," but acknowledged that other travellers think differently.
"A lot of people will say, 'Screw it!
I don't care!'
And that's where the problem lies," Haslam said.
'We don't have superpowers'
The situation has air crews and their unions calling for more safeguards to prevent sick travellers from boarding aircraft.
"We're being told daily that there are people coming back ill.
[There are] people coming back, you know, wearing masks, protecting themselves, but they're still ill passengers," said Wesley Lesosky, president of the Air Canada Component of the Canadian Union of Public Employees.

Tougher passenger screening needed, says union Duration 3:13 Sick travellers onboard pose threat to flight attendants says union
He said flight attendants are currently exempt from the 14-day self-isolation rules and that many are worried they are being unfairly exposed to the virus.
"We don't have superpowers.
We need to realize that we're humans, too.
And we can contract the same things that a passenger can on board," he said.
Canada has not yet adopted measures to test arriving passengers for the coronavirus, as is being done in at least a dozen countries around the world.
Commonly these are temperature checks or thermal screenings to detect passengers with a fever, and it's being done in countries like the United Arab Emirates, South Africa and Indonesia.

A number of Canadians flying home from Mexico this past week report that airport authorities in that country are screening all passengers for fevers using thermal-sensing cameras, noting Canada has no such technology in place.
'Dangerous' working conditions
Signs of stepped-up screening at the four Canadian airports that are still receiving international flights — in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto and Montreal — include increased signage and additional Canada Border Services Agency officers asking passengers questions.
Flight attendants say it's simply not enough.
In recent days, they have been provided N-95 masks and gloves, but one flight attendant for Air Canada who works on transatlantic flights said she and her colleagues are being put at risk.
"Why aren't we forced to quarantine when we get back home?"
she asked.

"If I've caught something, I pass it on to many, many more!"
she wrote in a text message.
"We are just going to keep spreading it all over the world again.
"
"As much as I'm proud to repatriate all my fellow Canadians, I'm also getting scared to work in these dangerous conditions.

At first glance, it's hard to believe Aaron Estrada is anything other than a healthy 4-year-old, but it has taken a year for the energetic little boy to get here.
In November 2020, Aaron was in a hospital bed for more than a week, requiring oxygen to breathe, after contracting COVID.
His hair started falling out, he had heart problems, and he couldn't walk or stand for a month.
Correspondent Meg Oliver asked Aaron, "Do you remember, after you got sick, how it made your legs feel?"
"Bad," he replied.
He developed a severe COVID-related life-threatening condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, which causes major organs to become inflamed.
Oliver asked Concepcion Ruiz, Aaron's mother, "What was going through your mind?
"
Crying, Ruiz said, "Very sad, emotional.
"
Aaron Estrada developed a severe COVID-related life-threatening condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.
CBS News
A recent U.K. study found that COVID still affects one in seven kids months after infection.
One study of long COVID symptoms in children suggested that more than half of those between 6 and 16 years old who contract COVID have at least one symptom that lasts more than 120 days.
Dr. Katharine Clouser, at Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey, says her pediatric hospital has seen an increase in the number of kids with long-hauler symptoms.
She and her team opened one of the first pediatric COVID recovery centers in the state last spring, to help Aaron and other kids like him.
When asked to describe long-hauler symptoms, Clouser said, "In children, we tend to see that they have persistent fatigue.
Some kids are having persistent headaches, and a lot of kids are having anxiety symptoms that maybe they didn't have before.
"
A recent study found young people with pre-existing conditions (such as chronic kidney disease, immune disorders or heart disease) are 25 times more likely to get severe COVID than those without.
But Aaron Estrada had no known pre-existing conditions – nor did 14-year-old Madison Foor from Michigan.
"It feels a little scary, like I just can't breathe," she said.
Madison is a competitive dancer.
She was healthy and thriving before she got COVID in January.
She never used an inhaler before, but 10 months later, she still needs one, and gets winded easily, especially while dancing.
"I get really tired, and I need to sit down, and my heart starts pumping really fast and my lungs – just like [a] constant need for air," she said.
Months after contracting COVID, Madison Foor needs an inhaler, as she now gets winded easily.
CBS News
Her mother, Mariha Lyn Foor, said, "I'm worried about, this could have done more damage than what we even realize.
But I'm also worried that she'll also need the inhaler for the rest of her life to do things such as take long walks, or bike rides, or need it for dance.
"
As for Aaron, doctors are hopeful that with time and continued treatment, he will make a full recovery.
Oliver asked Aaron, "What do you want to say to your doctors who helped you learn to walk again?"
"Gracias," he replied.
Children are eligible for the Pfizer vaccine once they turn five years old.
The CDC estimates, so far, about 900,000 children in the U.S. between ages five and 11 have received their first dose of the COVID vaccine.
While Aaron won't turn five until this spring, his doctor wants him to get the shot this month given how severe his reaction to COVID was.
His doctor told "CBS Mornings" she hopes the vaccine will help decrease long-haul cases, and there is already some evidence it's reducing long-hauler symptoms in kids like Aaron.
Summer weather has not stopped spread of coronavirus, and a new study identifies 6 "types" of COVID
A new study of COVID-19, based on data from a symptom tracker app, determined that there are six distinct "types" of the disease involving different clusters of symptoms.
The discovery could potentially open new possibilities for how doctors can better treat individual patients and predict what level of hospital care they would need.
Researchers from King's College London studied data from approximately 1,600 U.K. and U.S. patients who regularly logged their symptoms in the COVID Symptom Tracker App in March and April.
Typically, doctors will look for key symptoms such as cough, fever and loss of the sense of smell to detect COVID-19.
The study, which has not been peer-reviewed, says the six different "types" of COVID-19 can vary by severity and come with their own set of symptoms.
"I think it's very, very interesting," Dr. Bob Lahita, who is not affiliated with the study, told CBSN anchors Vladimir Duthiers and Anne-Marie Green.
"Among the patients I see, those who recovered, many of them present different ways: some people with fever and some without fever, and some with nausea and vomiting, some people with diarrhea, etc."
The six clusters of symptoms outlined in the study are:
Flu-like with no fever: Headache, loss of smell, muscle pains, cough, sore throat, chest pain, no fever.
Flu-like with fever: Headache, loss of smell, cough, sore throat, hoarseness, fever, loss of appetite.
Gastrointestinal: Headache, loss of smell, loss of appetite, diarrhea, sore throat, chest pain, no cough.
Severe level one, fatigue: Headache, loss of smell, cough, fever, hoarseness, chest pain, fatigue.
Severe level two, confusion: Headache, loss of smell, loss of appetite, cough, fever, hoarseness, sore throat, chest pain, fatigue, confusion, muscle pain.
Severe level three, abdominal and respiratory: Headache, loss of smell, loss of appetite, cough, fever, hoarseness, sore throat, chest pain, fatigue, confusion, muscle pain, shortness of breath, diarrhea, abdominal pain.
The first level, "flu-like with no fever," is associated with headaches, loss of smell, muscle pains, cough, sore throat and chest pain.
Patients at this level have a 1.5% chance of needing breathing support such as oxygen or a ventilator.
The second type, "flu-like with fever," includes symptoms like loss of appetite, headache, loss of smell, cough, sore throat, hoarseness and fever.
Researchers say about 4.4% of patients at this level needed breathing support.
Patients with the third type, simply described as "gastrointestinal," do not have a cough as part of their illness.
Instead, they experience headache, diarrhea, loss of smell, loss of appetite, sore throat and chest pain, and about 3.3% needed breathing support.
Lahita referred to the following three clusters of COVID-19 as the "really severe types.
"
In type four, or "severe level one," patients experience fatigue along with headache, loss of smell, cough, fever, hoarseness and chest pain.
Patients at this level needed breathing support at a rate of 8.6%.
Type five, "severe level two," includes the symptoms of type four along with loss of appetite, sore throat and muscle pain, and is mainly distinguished by confusion.
"That means you don't know where you are or where you live, whether you are in or out of the hospital, who your relatives are," Lahita explained.
"That is very scary."
Almost 10% of patients at that level need breathing support.
The most severe type of COVID-19 is referred to as "severe level three, abdominal and respiratory," and has all the above symptoms along with abdominal pain, shortness of breath and diarrhea.
Nearly 20% of these patients need breathing support.
"Those are the severe level threes who wind up on a ventilator, and then it is touch-and-go as to whether they survive the infection entirely," Lahita said.
The U.K. researchers also found that only 16% of patients with type one COVID-19 required hospitalization, compared with nearly half of the patients with type six.
Patients in the severe clusters also tended to be older or with pre-exisiting conditions and weakened immune systems, compared to those in the first three.
Scientists hope the discovery, once further studied, could help predict what types of care patients with COVID-19 might need, and give doctors the ability to predict which patients would fall into which category.
"I'm very happy that these six types have been identified and can give us an idea of a prognosis going forward for patients who are afflicted with this virus," Lahita said.

Long Covid is another public health crisis hidden inside the pandemic, medical experts have warned, with estimates of the patients suffering from the debilitating disease stretching to more than 100m worldwide.
Scientists are in the early stages of hunting for treatments that could ease symptoms, target the still unclear causes, and get people healthy enough to return to work.
A meta-analysis of studies by Penn State researchers found more than half of the 236m people who had Covid-19 when the paper was published — which has since risen to 275m — had symptoms lasting more than six months.
Amitava Banerjee, a professor of clinical data science at University College London, said even two years into the pandemic, we are “still caught in the headlights”, focused on dashboards that track intensive care admissions and deaths — but not the long Covid crisis.
How is long Covid defined?
Long Covid is defined as suffering symptoms 12 weeks or more after diagnosis.
A recent UK study discovered one in three of those admitted to hospital were suffering from long Covid a year later.
Rachael Evans, a clinical scientist at the UK’s National Institute for Health Research, said the post-hospital admission Covid-19 study helped sort sufferers into subgroups and steered work to discover new drugs.
“It really highlights the urgent need for treatments to be investigated and for healthcare support to improve recovery,” she added.
“None of us think that long Covid has one mechanism and one treatment.”
What are the symptoms of long Covid?
While patients suffer a range of symptoms, the most commonly reported are fatigue and breathing problems.
Some also experience damage to their organs and in the PHOSP study, one in 10 had clinically relevant cognitive impairment, often called “brain fog”.
Many symptoms resemble those in other post-viral diseases, including from coronaviruses.
Margaret O’Hara, a trustee at patient group Long Covid Support, fell sick with Covid-19 in April 2020, after assisting on a critical care coronavirus ward.
She experienced long Covid for a year — and then, after contracting the disease in October 2021, is suffering again.
“Just fatigue doesn’t really begin to describe the intensity,” she said.
“It’s so bizarre.
Sometimes I’ll get up in the morning and within an hour it is like I’ve been anaesthetised.
Like someone put a chloroform hanky over my mouth and I have to go lie down.”
Women, people with obesity, and those who were on invasive mechanical ventilation are all more likely to develop long Covid.
It is not clear the degree to which vaccination helps prevent long Covid — other than reducing the likelihood of developing acute Covid-19 — but self-reported data from the UK’s Zoe symptom tracking app suggest it halves the risk.
What causes long Covid?
A great deal remains unknown.
However, the PHOSP study provided an important clue that lends weight to a hypothesis that long Covid is caused by a continued immune reaction.
It found sufferers had increased inflammatory markers.
Researchers discovered that the people with the most severe long Covid, and those experiencing brain fog, had the highest levels of inflammation.
Sir Stephen Holgate, University of Southampton professor and co-founder of Synairgen, a company that is creating Covid-19 antiviral medication, said MRI scans had also shown inflamed organs.
“The body turns on itself as a result of all this inflammation during the Covid period and attacks its own tissue.”
There may be a genetic predisposition that determines who is most likely to suffer this kind of immune response, so researchers are conducting large genome-wide association studies that try to locate genes that patients have in common.
Another hypothesis is that the virus attacks the cells’ energy reserves, mitochondria.
Sub-groups could be suffering for different reasons — or both hypotheses could be true at once.
Are there drugs that could be repurposed?
The UK’s NHS and large US health systems have established long Covid clinics, which often offer physiotherapy and mental health support, but so far have not had many pharmaceutical options.

Some physicians have been trying to use drugs with few side-effects that they believe could have an impact.
These are as diverse as the symptoms, including antihistamines and cytokine blockers to address inflammation, antacids, beta blockers and anti-clotting agents.
A recent small Cambridge study suggested taking a combination of “friendly bacteria” could help ease long Covid’s gut symptoms and improve overall wellbeing.
Banerjee aims to start a study in the new year, modelled on the Recovery Trial that helped identify useful drugs for treating acute Covid-19.
What are the future drugs in development?
Bill Hinshaw, chief executive of Boston-based biotech Axcella Therapeutics, said there were few products in the pipeline for long Covid — and even fewer targeting muscle fatigue and weakness.
Axcella and Oxford university are developing a drug to reduce inflammation and restore mitochondrial function.
They hope to have clinical trial data in the middle of this year.
“You have a certain amount of energy in the battery,” said Hinshaw.
“The virus comes in and takes over the battery and . . .
damages it so the battery can no longer hold the charge properly.”
Others are focusing on a subset of patients.
For example, digital therapeutics pioneer Akili Interactive is creating a game for people suffering from brain fog.
PureTech Health is working on a drug for lung tissue damage, which is in a phase 2 trial.
Michael Chen, head of innovation at the London-listed biotech, said almost half of those with long Covid experienced breathlessness, so “millions and millions” could have lung scarring.
“It’s a little bit of a terrifying thought and a window into the public health crisis that could be long Covid in the future.”
World Health Organisation (WHO) has recently notified that over 500 Omicron variants are currently circulating worldwide and owing to that, India is likely to see a Covid wave in the coming days.
The Union Health ministry in India had in December alerted that the coming 40 days would be crucial, even as it tightened its grip on Covid testing of inbound passengers from China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Republic of Korea, Thailand and Japan.
Meanwhile, India on Wednesday recorded 175 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the active tally to 2,570.
Recently, four cases of the BF.7 variant, which is behind China's recent infection surge, has been reported from India.
However it is to be noted that the alarm by the health ministry was sounded keeping in mind that winter witnesses several respiratory illness which may necessarily not be Covid-19.
Winters in India also increases the risk of common cold, flu and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Infection.
It is imperative that one notes the crucial difference in symptoms of the various infection which sets them apart from Coivd-19.
Loss of taste and smell is has been observed to be a common symptoms during respiratory illness.
People who get viral infections often lose their sense of taste and smell.
This remained a quintessential symptom of testing for Covid-19 during the first wave of the pandemic.
However, experts have pointed out that stuffy nose reduces the ability of the human body to taste or smell something.
Common Cold
Common cold is a viral infection of the nose and throat.
The typical symptoms of common cold are
-Cough
-Runny nose
-Stuffy nose
-Sneezing
-Sore throat
-Difficulty in breathing
-Fever
-Headache
-Muscle pain
-Body ache
-Vomiting
-Diarrhea
Kids have been noted to be wheezing if they are suffering from common cold.
Influenza
Influenza or flu is caused by influenza virus types A and B, which cause acute respiratory illnesses.
The severity of the illness is higher in children aged 5-9 years of age.
The symptoms of flu are
-Cough
-Fatigue
-Fever
-Headache
-Muscle pain
-Body aches
-Runny nose
-Sneezing
-Sore throat
-Vomiting
-Diarrhea
Occasionally symptoms like difficulty in breathing and wheezing is also seen in people who are down with flu.
In children including the infants, the first infection may cause severe bronchiolitis which can be fatal sometimes.
In older children and adults without comorbidities, repeated upper respiratory tract infections are common and range from subclinical infection to symptomatic upper respiratory tract disease.
RSV
The classic symptoms of RSV infection are
-Cough
-Runny or stuffy nose
-Wheezing
-Sneezing
-Fever
-Headache
Covid-19 around the world
The BF.7 variant is driving the surge in Covid-19 cases in China.
While the east Asian country is reporting at least 9000 cases in a day.
This sudden rise in cases occurred after years of hardline containment restrictions were dismantled last month.

As many as eight different types of skin rash could be a sign you have coronavirus - and especially in kids
Doctors are now urging parents and the public to be aware of the new symptom - and to make sure people are aware of the different Covid-19 symptoms.
It comes as schools are increasingly being affected by cases and being told to self-isolate.
Covid-19 cases have spiked so much recently that Boris Johnson ordered a series of measures in an address on Tuesday evening in a bid to keep the virus under control and avoid a second full lockdown in the UK.
4,926 people tested positive for Coronavirus in the UK up to 4pm on Tuesday, and there were 37 deaths.
Altogether in the UK, 41,825 people have now died within 28 days of a test, and 403,551 have tested positive.
King's College London experts and the British Association of Dermatologists have compiled 400 photos and information on eight different types of rashes.
The skin rashes appear to be linked to coronavirus, according to the leading medical research.
The eight categories are:
hive-type rash (urticaria) (itchy raised bumps over any part of the body)
(itchy raised bumps over any part of the body) ' prickly heat' or chickenpox-type rash (usually on the elbows and knees, as well as backs of hands and feet)
(usually on the elbows and knees, as well as backs of hands and feet)
'Covid toe' (reddish or purplish bumps on the fingers or toes which can be very sore)
(reddish or purplish bumps on the fingers or toes which can be very sore) Pityriasis rosea ( a relatively common skin condition that causes a temporary rash of raised red scaly patches on the body.
It can affect anyone, but it's more common in older children and young adults (aged 10 to 35)
a relatively common skin condition that causes a temporary rash of raised red scaly patches on the body.
It can affect anyone, but it's more common in older children and young adults (aged 10 to 35) neck and chest eczema
Purpuric (the rash looks like little red spots on the skin.
It's easy to recognise because - unlike other spotty rashes - the spots don't fade when you press them.
The best way to do this is with a drinking glass or other see-through object like a plastic ruler).

Exanthem (a symmetrical rash of reddish blotches or bumps, usually accompanied by a viral illness)
Consultant dermatologist Veronique Bataille told The Sun: "Our research shows that rashes can be more predictive of Covid-19 than fever and cough, particularly in children.
"We found that one in six children gets a rash without any other classical symptoms.
"For most, Covid-19 rashes last for a few weeks and eventually disappear.
In some cases, prescribed medication may be needed if the rash is very itchy.
"
GMB's Dr Hilary Jones has also spoken about rashes as a symptom of coronavirus, telling the presenters that it was a common sign from a symptom tracker app: "So when we looked at the tracker app that was set up by King's College, as you say one in 11 people said that whilst they had other symptoms, they also had this persistent skin rash.
"And we've known about skin rashes for quite a little while.
"And it seems to be particularly in those few children who have COVID-19 that the skin rashes is present.
"Dermatologist skin specialists have been calling it COVID toe for some time so the digits of the feet become affected by a blistery itchy red rash which is pathognomonic very typical of COVID-19.
"
It comes as Boris Johnson said that continuing lockdown would affect vulnerable and lonely people and keep children out of education.
"If we let this virus get out of control now, it would mean that our NHS had no space, once again, to deal with cancer patients and millions of other non-Covid medical needs," he said.
"If we were forced into a new national lockdown, that would threaten not just jobs and livelihoods but the loving human contact on which we all depend.
"It would mean renewed loneliness and confinement for the elderly and vulnerable, and ultimately it would threaten once again the education of our children.
"We must do all we can to avoid going down that road again.
"If people don't follow the rules we have set out, then we must reserve the right to go further.
"We must take action now because a stitch in time saves nine; and this way we can keep people in work, we can keep our shops and our schools open, and we can keep our country moving forward while we work together to suppress the virus.".
Pink eye, or conjunctivitis, was not originally associated with the coronavirus until recently when a new strain of the omicron variant emerged.
This new strain of the omicron variant, XBB.1.16 or otherwise known as “Arcturus,” is affecting 1 in 10 people across the country.
Red eyes new symptom of COVID-19 Arcturus: Jakarta Health Office
We are still processing the screening (of patients with the symptom) through genome sequencing
Jakarta (ANTARA) -
The Jakarta Health Office noted that red eyes is one of the new symptoms found in COVID-19 patients infected with the XBB.1.16 or Arcturus subvariant.
"Based on data in India, the Arcturus subvariant, which is still a derivative of Omicron, is said to have a new symptom that is different from other variants, namely red eyes," the office's Head of Surveillance and Immunization Section, Ngabila Salama, stated through a text message here on Saturday.
Salama explained that the symptom of red eyes is followed by eye discharge, loud cough, and chest pain akin to a sharp pull.
Regarding the previous finding of two Arcturus patients in Jakarta, the duo did not exhibit the symptom of red eyes.
However, several COVID-19 patients with the symptom of red eyes had received treatment in hospitals.
"We are still processing the screening (of patients with the symptom) through genome sequencing," she revealed.
Salama underlined that as long as the trend of treatment in hospitals and death cases do not increase, the COVID-19 pandemic situation, especially in Jakarta, should be safe and under control.
Nevertheless, she appealed to all parties to increase alertness against the transmission of Arcturus that has entered Indonesia.
This is because based on the situation in India -- as one of the countries that experienced a surge in cases due to Arcturus -- the variant largely infects children.
According to Salama, there has been no significant increase in COVID-19 cases among children caused by Arcturus in Jakarta.
To avoid severe symptoms and prevent an increase in bed occupancy rate (BOR), she appealed to parents to complete the vaccination.
Children aged 12-17 can receive two vaccine doses of the Pfizer vaccine.
Meanwhile, people aged 18 years and above can get up to four doses of the vaccine by Pfizer, Indovac, and Inavac.
"Stay alert against the new variant of COVID-19.
Do not panic, but it is advisable to keep complying with health protocols by wearing a mask to prevent illness with severe symptoms and fatality," she emphasized.

WASHINGTON:
The National Institutes of Health is beginning a handful of studies to test possible treatments for long Covid , an anxiously awaited step in U.S. efforts against the mysterious condition that afflicts millions.
Monday’s announcement from the NIH’s $1.15 billion RECOVER project comes amid frustration from patients who’ve struggled for months or even years with sometimes-disabling health problems — with no proven treatments and only a smattering of rigorous studies to test potential ones.
“This is a year or two late and smaller in scope than one would hope but nevertheless it’s a step in the right direction,” said Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly of Washington University in St. Louis, who isn’t involved with NIH’s project but whose own research highlighted long Covid’s toll.
Getting answers is critical, he added, because “there’s a lot of people out there exploiting patients’ vulnerability” with unproven therapies.
Scientists don’t yet know what causes long Covid, the catchall term for about 200 widely varying symptoms.
Between 10% and 30% of people are estimated to have experienced some form of long Covid after recovering from a coronavirus infection, a risk that has dropped somewhat since early in the pandemic.
“If I get 10 people, I get 10 answers of what long Covid really is," U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said.
That's why so far the RECOVER initiative has tracked 24,000 patients in observational studies to help define the most common and burdensome symptoms — findings that now are shaping multipronged treatment trials.
The first two will look at:— Whether taking up to 25 days of Pfizer's antiviral drug Paxlovid could ease long Covid, because of a theory that some live coronavirus, or its remnants, may hide in the body and trigger the disorder.
Normally Paxlovid is used when people first get Covid-19 and for just five days.
— Treatments for “brain fog” and other cognitive problems.
They include Posit Science Corp.’s BrainHQ cognitive training program, another called PASC-Cognitive Recovery by New York City’s Mount Sinai Health System, and a Soterix Medical device that electrically stimulates brain circuits.
Two additional studies will open in the coming months.
One will test treatments for sleep problems.
The other will target problems with the autonomic nervous system — which controls unconscious functions like breathing and heartbeat — including the disorder called POTS.A more controversial study of exercise intolerance and fatigue also is planned, with NIH seeking input from some patient groups worried that exercise may do more harm than good for certain long Covid sufferers.
The trials are enrolling 300 to 900 adult participants for now but have the potential to grow.
Unlike typical experiments that test one treatment at a time, these more flexible “platform studies” will let NIH add additional potential therapies on a rolling basis.
“We can rapidly pivot,” Dr. Amy Patterson with the NIH explained.
A failing treatment can be dropped without ending the entire trial and “if something promising comes on the horizon, we can plug it in.
”The flexibility could be key, according to Dr. Anthony Komaroff, a Harvard researcher who isn’t involved with the NIH program but has long studied a similarly mysterious disorder known as chronic fatigue syndrome or ME/CFS.
For example, he said, the Paxlovid study “makes all sorts of sense,” but if a 25-day dose shows only hints of working, researchers could extend the test to a longer course instead of starting from scratch.
Komaroff also said that he understands people's frustration over the wait for these treatment trials, but believes NIH appropriately waited “until some clues came in about the underlying biology," adding: “You’ve got to have targets.”
As another school year begins, the contagious delta variant of COVID-19 has infected more children and teens across the U.S. Individual symptoms can vary, and these symptoms should be monitored carefully for short- and long-term complications.
Mild symptoms
Many children with COVID-19 have minimal to no symptoms.
Their symptoms often resemble a cold with congestion, cough, low-grade fever and fatigue.
Over-the counter pain and fever reducers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, can be given as needed to relieve symptoms.
Staying hydrated with adequate intake of fluids is encouraged, as with illnesses such as the flu.
Other symptoms, such as loss of taste and smell, cannot be treated specifically, but they generally resolve with time.
Talk with your child’s health care provider if you have questions about managing symptoms.
Despite mild initial symptoms, children 12 and older at higher risk of complications may be given monoclonal antibody therapy to help them fight the infection.
Those at higher risk are children with severe asthma or other lung disease; neuromuscular conditions, such as Down syndrome and cerebral palsy; obesity; and any condition that affects the immune system.
Monoclonal antibody therapy, which is designed to prevent COVID-19 from worsening, should be given as soon as possible after a COVID-19 diagnosis is made.
All the children that Mayo Clinic Health System tests are screened to see if they are eligible for monoclonal antibody therapy.
If you are unsure of your child’s risk and eligibility, contact his or her health care provider.
Regardless of symptom severity, it is crucial to isolate to stop the spread of the infection while monitoring for symptoms that should prompt further evaluation.
Children need to be evaluated by a health care provider if they display any of these symptoms:
Shortness of breath
Chest pressure or pain
Severe vomiting
Change in consciousness
Color change in skin, lips or nail beds
These symptoms can occur at the beginning of the illness or as long as a week into the infection.
Moderate to severe symptoms
Unfortunately, some children and teens experience more concerning symptoms.
These symptoms generally should be managed in conjunction with their primary care provider or, if needed, in the hospital.
Parents should be vigilant for any signs that could indicate more severe infection, including:
Mental changes or confusion
Trouble breathing
Persistent chest pain
Bluish lips or face
Severe vomiting
Decrease in urination
These symptoms indicate that urgent evaluation may be needed.
Call 911 or seek emergency care.
Supportive treatments for moderate to severe symptoms can include oxygen and IV fluids, or more specific COVID-19 treatments like remdesivir and dexamethasone.
Remdesivir is an antiviral medication generally used in hospitalized patients to stop COVID-19 from reproducing itself and lessen the severity of disease.
Dexamethasone decreases the inflammatory response in the body, and it can help with breathing and other symptoms of moderate to severe COVID-19 infection.
Myocarditis
For those children and teens who experience more moderate or severe symptoms of COVID-19 infection, follow-up is essential to ensure a safe return to activity.
COVID-19 can cause myocarditis, which is an inflammation of the heart muscle.
This condition should be fully resolved before a return to sports activities.
Any symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, fainting or heart palpitations could indicate myocarditis.
Even in cases of mild illness, a health care provider should evaluate any difficulty in return to play.
Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children
Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C, can occur several weeks after a mild or asymptomatic case of COVID-19.
While symptoms can vary, they generally include a high fever and inflammation in almost any organ system.
This requires early evaluation and often hospitalization for supportive care and treatment.
Consult with a health care provider if symptoms of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children develop in your child or teen.

Fever, runny nose and sore throat are no more the top symptoms of COVID right now.
People experiencing muscle pain is seen more often right now than before.
Also, the symptoms seen in vaccinated, partially vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals differs a lot.
Hoarse voice, cough with phlegm, altered sense of smell, sneezing and blocked nose are also seen commonly in COVID patients these days.
An Island firm has developed a new app where people can track Covid-19 symptoms.
The Health Monitoring Service App has been put together by Health Monitoring Services Ltd. which believes it represents a 'major step forward' in tracking progress of the pandemic.
Users simply answer a series of pre-set, symptom related questions twice a day, once in the morning and once again in the evening.
Each question is given a value which assess symptom severity - the App will evaluate the responses and produce a Green, Yellow, Amber or Red response.
Within each colour group, the identified symptoms are ranked 1 to ten in order of severity.
Green is all clear, Yellow is slight shift in symptom based on 1 or 2 ‘yes’ answers whilst an Amber response starts the self-isolation process moving to red indicating that the person needs medical intervention.
At each stage, the App will give the user full guidance on what to do next, based on the government’s latest guidance or instructions.
Health Monitoring Services CEO, Dion Croom, says: "Tracking the development of Covid-19 through the progression of the symptoms will yield invaluable information to governments, employers and healthcare organisations.
"The Health Monitoring Service App removes that stumbling block by giving an up-to-the-minute profile of the deadly virus, its progression, its severity and its geographical spread.
"At the same time, individual users with be able to make informed judgements based on their own personalised profile together with best advice from government."
COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory disease first discovered in late 2019, caused by the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
The majority of people with COVID-19 develop mild symptoms such as a cough, fever, and fatigue.
People over age 65 and people with underlying health conditions like diabetes or obesity are at the highest risk of developing a severe case.
COVID-19 can cause nasal symptoms similar to upper respiratory infections, such as a stuffy or runny nose.
Some anecdotal reports and case studies also describe people with COVID-19 developing a nose burning sensation.
Keep reading as we take a deeper look at whether a burning sensation in your nose is a common symptom of COVID-19.
We’ll also take a look at how the symptoms of COVID-19 compare with those of other respiratory infections and allergies.
Is a burning sensation in the nose a sign of COVID-19?
Burning in your nose can potentially be a symptom of COVID-19, but it’s not one of the most common symptoms.
The only medical studies examining nose burning are isolated case studies.
So, at this time, it’s not clear how frequently people experience it.
What causes a burning sensation in your nose?
A burning sensation in your nose can be caused by inflammation in your sinuses from a sinus infection.
Viruses, fungi, and bacteria can cause sinus infections.
One August 2020 study of 1,773 people with COVID-19 found that 4.1 percent developed nasal congestion and 2.1 percent developed a runny nose.
These conditions can lead to a blockage of the sinuses that encourages the growth of bacteria or fungi.
Case studies Sinus infections don’t seem to be common among people with COVID-19, but a few case reports have noted them.
A study published in the Journal of Surgical Case Reports in March 2021 describes a 52-year-old man with COVID-19 who developed a severe sinus infection that led to erosion of bone on the floor of his sinus and complications in his right eye.
It was unclear if COVID-19 was the only cause of or a contributing factor to the infection.
However, negative fungal and bacterial cultures suggest that COVID-19 may have played a major role.
A February 2021 study examined three people with COVID-19 requiring intensive care, who developed fungal sinus infections.
Fungal sinus infections have a high mortality rate among immunocompromised people.
All three people in the study died from other COVID-19 complications.
Again, most people don’t appear to get a sinus infection from COVID-19.
How COVID-19 targets cells in your nose According to an April 2020 review , researchers think that COVID-19 enters your cells through an enzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2).
ACE-2 is found in as high a concentration in your nasal cavity as well as any other part of your upper respiratory or digestive tract.
ACE-2 is also found in other parts of your body, such as your gastrointestinal tract, lungs, blood vessels, and heart.
The highest concentration of ACE-2 in your nose is found in mucus-producing goblet cells and ciliated epithelial cells, which are cells that line the tract of your nasal cavity.
Researchers have also found that COVID-19 also needs a protein called TMPRSS2 to optimally enter a cell.
TMPRSS2 has also been identified in the cells that line your nose, according to June 2020 research .
Mouse studies have found that reducing levels of this protein in mice led to decreased replication of the COVID-19 virus.
Most common nasal symptoms of COVID-19 According to a 2021 study published in the American Journal of Otolaryngology, about 33 percent of people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms affecting the nose, such as loss of smell or taste.
Loss or reduction of taste and smell are frequently reported as early symptoms of COVID-19.
One July 2020 study found that 73 percent of people reported a loss of smell prior to COVID-19 diagnosis and 26.6 percent of people reported it as the initial symptom.
Other nasal symptoms linked to COVID-19 include: stuffy nose
runny nose
post-nasal drip
trouble breathing out of the nose
COVID-19 symptoms vs. respiratory tract infection and allergies The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to the symptoms of other upper respiratory infections and allergies.
Here’s a look at how the typical symptoms of COVID-19, the flu, colds, and allergies compare.
COVID-19 Influenza Common cold Allergies runny or stuffy nose runny or stuffy nose runny or stuffy nose runny or stuffy nose fatigue fatigue fatigue fatigue body aches body aches body aches shortness of breath cough cough cough wheezing sore throat sore throat sore throat sneezing headache headache sneezing itchy eyes, nose, or throat chills chills loss of taste swollen or puffy eyelids fever fever loss of smell red or pink eyes nausea nausea diarrhea diarrhea red or pink eyes sneezing shortness of breath skin rash loss of taste loss of smell A few key symptoms may help identify your condition: Allergy symptoms tend to last for weeks or months and include sneezing.
Fever and body aches aren’t symptoms of allergies.
Sneezing isn’t a symptom of COVID-19.
Allergy symptoms typically don’t include coughing, unless you have a lot of drainage in your nose.
The flu and colds don’t typically lead to shortness of breath.
When they do, it usually isn’t as severe as it is with COVID-19.
When to contact a doctor Most people with COVID-19 develop mild symptoms.
Mild COVID-19 can be treated at home by: getting plenty of rest
staying hydrated
taking over-the-counter medications like Tylenol to help manage symptoms It’s important to isolate yourself as much as possible and to avoid public areas.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , most adults can stop isolating 10 days after symptom onset and 24 hours after their fever is gone without the use of medication.
Medical emergency
It’s important to seek immediate medical attention if you or a loved one have emergency symptoms of COVID-19.
Many hospitals have separate wings dedicated to treating COVID-19 and take walk-ins.
The CDC’s list of emergency symptoms includes: trouble breathing
persistent pain or pressure in your chest
an inability to stay awake or wake up
pale gray or blue lips, nails, or skin
other concerning symptoms People with dark skin may have more difficulty noticing discoloration in their nails, lips, or skin.
Discoloration in these areas suggests oxygen deprivation.
SEEING RED Covid symptoms – sore, itchy eyes could be early coronavirus warning sign, experts say
AS the pandemic has evolved, we've come to understand more about the symptoms of coronavirus.
Whilst the key signs are a fever, a cough and a loss of taste and smell, it's also becoming clear that there are other less common symptoms.

2 Sore, itchy eyes could be a sign of coronavirus, experts say Credit: Getty Images - Getty
Experts now believe that having problems with the eyes could be an indicator that someone has contracted Covid-19.
A recent study found that having sore, itchy eyes was one of the most significant ocular symptom in Covid patients.
The findings, published in the BMJ Open Ophthalmology, also found light sensitivity, known medically as photophobia, was another sign.
Researchers from Anglia Ruskin University studied data from 83 Covid-19 patients.
They found the most reported symptoms were dry cough (66 per cent), fever (76 per cent), fatigue (90 per cent) and loss of smell/taste (70 per cent).
But looking in more detail at eye-related symptoms they found 18 per cent had suffered from photophobia, 17 per cent had itchy eyes and 16 per cent had sore eyes.
They found that the frequency of sore eyes was significantly higher while experiencing the main Covid symptoms, rather than beforehand.
But 81 per cent had reported to have experienced the eye symptoms within two weeks of other Covid symptoms.
Four in five patients said the eye-related problems lasted for less than two weeks, and there was no difference between male and females.
PREVIOUS STUDIES
Reports have suggested that Covid-19 may cause eye infections such as conjunctivitis.
And the World Health Organisation lists it as one of the less common coronavirus signs.
Early in the pandemic, Italian researchers found Covid could remain in a person's eyes for up to 21 days after they first develop symptoms.
Scientists at the National Institute for Infectious Diseases found a 65-year-old woman had red, infected eyes before the classic coronavirus signs showed.
The team treating the patient started swabbing the woman's eyes - taking samples of her eye fluid almost every day following that.
Every sample revealed genetic material (RNA) from the virus that causes Covid-19, also known as SARS-CoV-2.
The virus remained in the woman's eyes for exactly three weeks - until she was discharged 21 days after she was admitted to hospital.
Despite this, the researchers examined her five days later and found the virus had returned to her eye fluid.
Coronavirus was still lingering in her eyes even days after her nasal swabs were clear of its genetic material.
That suggested to the researchers that the virus was continuing to make copies of itself within the woman's eye fluid.
They warned that conjunctivitis could be an early sign of Covid.
2
But the team in Cambridge wanted to find out more on the unusual symptom of what's understood to be a respiratory virus.
The study was led by Professor Shahina Pardhan, director of the vision and eye research unit at the Anglia Ruskin University School of Medicine.
She said her team decided to carry out the research as to date, there had been no studies looking at which eye symptoms were most frequently experienced by Covid sufferers.
They also wanted to know how long they lasted for or whether they emerged at the same time as other known symptoms.
She concluded: "The most significant ocular symptom experienced by people suffering from Covid-19 was sore eyes.
"Other symptoms associated with other types of conjunctivitis, such as mucous discharge and gritty eyes linked to bacterial infection, did not reach significance.
"The term ‘conjunctivitis’ is too broad and should be used with caution.
"
The NHS doesn't list red eyes - or any eye issues - on its official list of symptoms.
While the College of Optometrists and The Royal College of Ophthalmologists say it is unlikely patients would develop red eyes without other symptoms of coronavirus.
A spokeswoman said: "Recent reports have suggested that Covid-19 may cause conjunctivitis, and it is known that viral particles can be found in tears, which has caused some concern amongst eye health professionals.
"It is recognised that any upper respiratory tract infection may result in viral conjunctivitis as a secondary complication, and this is also the case with Covid-19.
"However, it is unlikely that a person would present with viral conjunctivitis secondary to Covid-19 without other symptoms of fever or a continuous cough as conjunctivitis seems to be a late feature where is has occurred."
As we enter Month 7 of the coronavirus pandemic, we know that one of the best ways to prevent the spread of the coronavirus is to avoid contact with other people if you're feeling sick.
Given that getting a COVID-19 test in the US still isn't easy, thanks to shortages and long wait times for test results, knowing the list of symptoms can help you identify if you should quarantine.
This article has been updated with the latest information.
However, there's a catch.
The list of symptoms for the coronavirus overlaps with infections of other viruses, including influenza and rhinovirus, the virus that causes the common cold.
That means it's going to be difficult to determine whether you have COVID-19 or the flu with a test.
However, no matter which you have, you should still stay home, wear a mask, frequently wash your hands and keep your distance from others.
The same goes for the common cold too.

COVID-19 symptoms
The following is a list of COVID-19 symptoms as outlined by the CDC.
You'll notice that many of these symptoms, including fever, body aches and a sore throat, are also common with the flu.
More unusually, one possible sign of a coronavirus infection is a loss of taste or smell.
Fever or chills
Cough
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Fatigue
Muscle or body aches
Headache
New loss of taste or smell
Sore throat
Congestion or runny nose
Nausea or vomiting
Diarrhea
Just because you have any of the above symptoms, it doesn't necessarily mean you have the coronavirus.
The CDC also states that "this list is not all-inclusive."
So if you feel ill, call your health care provider.
If you suspect that you or someone in your household has COVID-19 but isn't ill enough for hospitalization, here's everything you need to know about taking care of the sick person.
And if you believe that testing is necessary in your situation, here's what you need to know about finding a coronavirus testing site near you.
SYMPTOM CHECKER How to tell if your symptoms are from original Covid – or the deadlier new strain
KNOWING the key coronavirus symptoms is the best way to spot it early and prevent spreading it to others.
But with new and potentially more infectious strains of Covid emerging, it's more important than ever to be aware of the signs.

Most of the new variants have only evolved in the past few of months and so far experts have said it's not yet clear whether the symptoms differ.
However, a new Office for National Statistics report has revealed the most common signs of the UK variant aren't the same as the original variant.
People suffering with the Kent mutation, which first emerged in September 2020, are more likely to get a cough, sore throat, tiredness and muscle pain, according to the ONS.
This differs from the three official symptoms listed by the NHS for the original strain, which are a cough, fever and loss of taste or sense of smell.
3
The report, released yesterday, said: "People testing positive compatible with the new UK variant were more likely to report any symptoms and the classic symptoms, but were less likely to report loss of taste and smell.
"There was no evidence of difference in the percentages reporting gastrointestinal symptoms.
"
The largest change in symptoms between the two strains is people are much less likely to report high temperatures.
The study found no real difference in reports of shortness of breath or headaches from patients with either the novel strain or the mutation.
What about the other variants?
As for the other known variants - including the South African and Brazilian strain - the Government haven't specified what the symptoms of the new strains are and research is ongoing.
After the other new variants were detected Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty said that symptoms aren't any different to the strain already circulating across the UK.
So for the time-being officials have stated that people should continue to follow the guidance on the symptoms of the original variant.
Speaking previously, the WHO's technical chief, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, said those infected with different variants had the same symptoms of the disease and there was no severity.
But she said the variant had increased transmission.
WHO's Executive Director Mike Ryan said the variant transmitted in the same way - through respiratory droplets from coughing or in the breath, and from infected surfaces.
The most common signs of Covid to look out for are a loss of taste and smell, a persistent cough, and a high temperature.
Meanwhile, the same measures of social distancing, face mask wearing and hand washing will still help to prevent you catching any strain of the coronavirus.
Here are the most common symptoms of Covid - in both the new UK variant and the original strain...
1.
A cough
The NHS states that one of the three key coronavirus symptoms is a new, persistent cough.
This is defined as coughing a lot for more than an hour or three or more coughing episodes in a day.
If you usually have a cough then it will be much worse that your usual cough
and it's likely to be more frequent.
It remains a key symptom of both the original and the new UK variant of coronavirus.
2.
Loss of taste and smell
A loss of taste and smell emerged as a symptom of the original Covid variant late into the first wave last year.
Public Health England (PHE) only added anosmia to the official list of Covid-19 symptoms in May 2020.
It was already identified as a symptom by the World Health Organisation (WHO) at this point.
However, it wasn't on the ONS list of most common symptoms reported by those who had been infected with the new UK variant.
In fact the ONS said a loss of taste and loss of smell were significantly less common in new variant compatible positives than triple positives.
3. High temperature
Another key symptom of the original Covid-19 variant - but not as common with the UK one - is a high temperature.
This means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back and the NHS states that you don't need to measure your temperature with a thermometer in order to check it.
If you do measure your temperature - a high reading would be classed as anything above 38C.
A high temperature is usually caused by your body fighting infection.
4. Tiredness
Fatigue isn't on the NHS's list of key symptoms for the original variant but is was reported more commonly for those infected with the new UK variant.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) lists tiredness as another key coronavirus symptom.
Many people who contract the virus say they don't feel as though they have the energy to undertake every day tasks in the same way that they could before.
5.
Muscle pain
Aching muscles or joints is reported in just 15 per cent of people with the original Covid virus.
Yet the ONS found it was much more common for people with the new UK variant.
Known medically as myalgia, 25 per cent of people reported suffering from muscle ache when infected with the Kent strain.
This compared with almost 22 per cent for those with the original strain.
6.
Sore throat
People infected with the new UK variant reported experiencing a sore throat more often than those with the original.
The ONS report found 21.88 per cent of those testing positive for the Kent strain had a sore throat, compared with 19 per cent for the original.
According to the World Health Organisation, this is even lower for the novel coronavirus strain at just 14 per cent of those infected.

Hair loss and sexual dysfunction, or low libido, have been added to the long list of symptoms of COVID-19 and those with long COVID
Suggesting some demographics are more at risk than others, researchers from the University of Birmingham have identified new symptoms of COVID-19 in long COVID sufferers, including hair loss and sexual dysfunction.
Patients with a primary care record of infection with COVID-19 reported 62 symptoms more frequently 12 weeks after initial infection when compared to patients who hadn’t contracted the virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines long COVID as a condition characterised by symptoms impacting everyday life, such as fatigue, shortness of breath and cognitive dysfunction, which occur after a history of probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Anonymised electronic health records of 2.4 million people in the UK were analysed
The data analysed 486,149 people with prior infection, as well as nine million people with no indication of coronavirus infection after matching for other clinical diagnoses.
These non-hospitalised patients most commonly carried three categories of symptoms, reported by people with persistent health problems after infection.
Patterns of symptoms tended to be grouped into respiratory symptoms, mental health and cognitive problems, and a broader range of symptoms.
The predominant new symptoms of long COVID included:
Anosmia (loss of sense of smell),
Amnesia
Apraxia (inability to perform familiar movements or commands)
Bowel incontinence
Erectile dysfunction and reduced libido
Hallucinations
Limb swelling
Hair loss
Shortness of breath
Chest pain
Fever
Who is at a greater risk of developing long COVID?
Females
Younger people
People belonging to black, mixed or other ethnic groups
People from low socioeconomic backgrounds
Smokers
People who are overweight or obese
What are the most common symptoms of COVID-19?
Omicron is most notably known for its 5 main symptoms:
Runny nose
Headaches
Mild or severe fatigue
Sneezing (if vaccinated)
Sore throat
Whereas Delta, the previous variant which dominated COVID-19 cases, was better known for:
Loss of taste and smell
Persistent cough
High temperatures
Sneezing (regardless of vaccination status)
Dr Shamil Haroon, Associate Clinical Professor in Public Health at the University of Birmingham is the senior author on the study, said: “This research validates what patients have been telling clinicians and policy makers throughout the pandemic, that the symptoms of long COVID are extremely broad and cannot be fully accounted for by other factors such as lifestyle risk factors or chronic health conditions.
“The symptoms we identified should help clinicians and clinical guideline developers to improve the assessment of patients with long-term effects from COVID-19, and to subsequently consider how this symptom burden can be best managed.”
Patient partner and co-author of this study, Jennifer Camaradou, added: “This study is instrumental in creating and adding further value to understanding the complexity and pathology of long COVID.
It highlights the degree and diversity of expression of symptoms between different clusters.
“Patients with pre-existing health conditions will also welcome the additional analysis on risk factors.
Several other patient partners involved in the therapies for long COVID (TLC) study have expressed their views on living with long COVID.”

Fatigue And Headache Most Common Signs of Long Covid
The study also found muscle aches, cough, changes in smell and taste, fever, chills and nasal congestion in the long list of lingering symptoms.
Hypertension was the most common medical condition reported by participants in addition to their bout with Covid.
New York:
Fatigue and headache are the most common symptoms reported by individuals on an average of over four months out from Covid-19 infection, finds a study.
The study, published in the journal ‘ScienceDirect’, reported preliminary findings from 200 patients enrolled on an average about 125 days after testing positive for Covid virus.
Eighty per cent of all the participants reported neurological symptoms with fatigue, the most common symptom, reported by 68.5 per cent, and headache close behind at 66.5 per cent.
A reason fatigue appears to be such a major factor among those who had Covid is potentially because levels of inflammation, the body’s natural response to an infection, remain elevated in some individuals, explained researchers from the Medical College of Georgia in the US.
The findings indicate that even though the antibodies to the virus itself may wane, persistent inflammation is contributing to some of the symptoms like fatigue, said Elizabeth Rutkowski, neurologist from the College.
She noted that patients with conditions like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, both considered autoimmune conditions that consequently also have high levels of inflammation, also include fatigue as a top symptom.
“They have body fatigue where they feel short of breath, they go to get the dishes done and they are feeling palpitations, they immediately have to sit down and they feel muscle soreness like they just ran a mile or more,” Rutkowski said.
“There is probably some degree of neurologic fatigue as well because patients also have brain fog, they say it hurts to think, to read even a single email and that their brain is just wiped out,” she added.
Long Covid symptoms: Important points to know
The study also found muscle aches, cough, changes in smell and taste, fever, chills and nasal congestion in the long list of lingering symptoms.
Just over half reported changes in smell (54.5 per cent) and taste (54 per cent) and nearly half the participants (47 per cent) met the criteria for mild cognitive impairment, with 30 per cent demonstrating impaired vocabulary and 32 per cent having impaired working memory.
Twenty-one per cent reported confusion, and hypertension was the most common medical condition reported by participants in addition to their bout with Covid.
“Our results support the growing evidence that there are chronic neuropsychiatric symptoms following Covid-19 infections,” Rutkowski said.
Problems like these as well as mild cognitive impairment and even impaired vocabulary may also reflect the long-term isolation Covid-19 produced for many individuals, Rutkowski said.
Neuropsychiatric symptoms are observed in the acute phase of infection, but there is a need for accurate characterisation of how symptoms evolve over time, the researchers said.

Wales is dealing with a "tripledemic" — rising rates of coronavirus, record levels of strep A/scarlet fever cases, and a winter flu season which has arrived earlier than usual.
The Welsh NHS Confederation has described demand on the system as "relentlessly high".
Call volumes to the NHS Wales 111 helpline have increased by a record 300% And one Welsh health board — Betsi Cadwaladr in north Wales — has declared a critical incident and cancelled all but the most urgent operations, partly because of these three infectious illnesses spreading through communities.
The NHS has provided a list of the symptoms of each of the three illnesses.
If you are worried that you or a loved one might have one of the infections, here are the symptoms you should know about:
Covid-19
a high temperature or shivering (chills) – a high temperature means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do not need to measure your temperature)
a new, continuous cough – this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes in 24 hours
a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste
shortness of breath
feeling tired or exhausted
an aching body
a headache
a sore throat
a blocked or runny nose
loss of appetite
diarrhoea
feeling sick or being sick.
The NHS describes the symptoms as "very similar to symptoms of other illnesses, such as colds and flu".
If you have Covid symptoms and either have a high temperature or do not feel well enough to do normal activities or go to work (or in the case of children, their educational setting), then try to stay home and avoid contact with others.
Get help from NHS 111 if you're worried about your symptoms or you're not sure what to do.
How long is it contagious?
You should: try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for .
avoiding meeting people at higher risk from COVID-19 for 10 days, especially if their immune system means they're at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19, even if they've had a COVID-19 vaccine.
Strep A
flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature, swollen glands or an aching body
sore throat (strep throat or tonsillitis)
a rash that feels rough, like sandpaper (scarlet fever)
scabs and sores (impetigo)
pain and swelling (cellulitis)
severe muscle aches
nausea and vomiting.
Most strep
A infections are not serious and can be treated with antibiotics, but in rare cases they can cause serious problems.
This is called invasive group A strep (iGAS).
It is important to get an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if:
your child is unwell and is getting worse
your child is feeding or eating much less than normal
your child has fewer wet nappies than usual or is peeing less than usual, or shows other signs of dehydration
your baby is under 3 months and has a temperature of 38C, or is 3 to 6 months and has a temperature of 39C or higher
your child is very tired or irritable.
The NHS says: "If your child does not seem to be seriously ill, you can usually look after them at home.
They should feel better in a few days.
If they're uncomfortable, you can give them children's paracetamol or children's ibuprofen.
Check the leaflet to make sure the medicine is suitable for your child and to see how much to give them.
A pharmacist can give you advice about how to ease your child's symptoms and whether you need to see a doctor.
"
The guidance adds: "If you or your child has a strep A infection, you should stay away from nursery, school or work for 24 hours after you start taking antibiotics.
This will help stop the infection spreading to other people.
Serious strep
A infections (invasive group A strep, iGAS) need to be treated in hospital with antibiotics."

How long does strep throat last?
Strep throat typically resolves in three to five days if untreated.
Despite the short duration, antibiotic treatment is recommended to reduce the risk of complications.
Symptoms typically resolve within one to three days following the start of antibiotics.
Flu (influenza)
a sudden high temperature
an aching body
feeling tired or exhausted
a dry cough
a sore throat
a headache
difficulty sleeping
loss of appetite
diarrhoea or tummy pain
feeling sick and being sick.
The NHS adds that flu symptoms are similar for children, but they can also get pain in their ear and appear less active.
Ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if you or your child have symptoms of flu and:
you're worried about your baby's or child's symptoms
you're 65 or over
you're pregnant
you have a long-term medical condition – for example, diabetes or a condition that affects your heart, lungs, kidneys, brain or nerves
you have a weakened immune system – for example, because of chemotherapy or HIV
your symptoms do not improve after 7 days.
If you want to know more about the impact the three infections are having on Wales, you can read more here.
How long does the flu last?
The symptoms of flu usually develop within 1 to 3 days of becoming infected.
Most people will feel better within a week.
However, you may have a lingering cough and still feel very tired for a further couple of weeks.

By this point in the long slog of the pandemic, many people know the telltale symptoms of a COVID-19 infection: a ragged ache in your throat, a pernicious cough, congestion, fever and full-body exhaustion.
But a tiny subset of people also develop less common symptoms, ones that can sound like hexes from a children’s story: hairy tongues, purple toes, welts that sprout on their faces.
"Every infectious disease has common and uncommon manifestations,” said Dr. Mark Mulligan, an infectious disease specialist at NYU Langone Health.
And as we learn more about the coronavirus, he said, we may better understand the underlying causes behind these infrequent symptoms — but until then, it’s largely guesswork.
Confounding symptoms have been a component of COVID since the start of the pandemic; the loss of taste and smell has become a disturbing sign of the disease.
COVID also has the potential to disrupt menstrual cycles, a side effect some women also reported after vaccination.
With coronavirus (COVID-19) cases again increasing at an alarming rate, a symptom of the virus is gaining new notice with more prevalence: delirium.

Policy
There’s still so much we don’t know about the coronavirus, but the developments surrounding the delirium symptoms have both doctors and researchers concerned, especially as to how it may affect younger patients.
There’s growing evidence linking delirium and coronavirus patients.
One study reports that between 20% and 30% of hospitalized coronavirus patients develop delirium while another study indicates as many as 70% of critically ill coronavirus patients are affected.
We spoke with neurocritical care specialist Pravin George, DO, about delirium in coronavirus patients and why it might be happening.
The types of delirium
According to Dr. George, delirium is getting more notice as a symptom now
but it’s likely it’s been a symptom of the virus all along.
It likely went unnoticed in early cases, partly because some coronavirus patients have been under the influence of sedatives.
And another reason has to do with the type of delirium.
There are two types of delirium:
Hyperactive delirium is the overactive form in which a patient can be aggressive and restless, sometimes suffering delusions or hallucinations
Hypoactive delirium is the underactive form in which patients may appear sleepy, slow to respond and are withdrawn, not communicating with others.
And it’s possible for a patient to have a mix of the two.
According to Dr. George, the sedatives given to patients might have masked the presence of hypoactive delirium in some patients.
But symptoms of hyperactive delirium like hallucinations are gaining more notice now.
While delirium isn’t currently listed as a COVID-19 symptom by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), “new confusion” is now included as a potential “emergency warning sign” of the presence of COVID-19.
What causes delirium in coronavirus patients?
According to Dr. George, one cause of delirium in COVID-19 patients could be a lack of oxygen because of how the virus attacks the lungs.
Another cause could be the body’s reaction to the virus.
“Inflammation caused by the way the body’s immune system overreacts to the virus could block blood to a patient’s brain,” says Dr. George.
Yet one more might be the virus actually attacking the brain.
“The virus may be attacking neurons within the brain tissue.
The brain has neurons that contain ACE2 receptors that are very similar to receptors found in the lungs that have served as gateways for the coronavirus to attack cells there,” says Dr. George.
More than a respiratory virus
It’s becoming clear that the coronavirus can attack more than just the respiratory system.
And more studies are linking the virus with damage to the body’s central nervous system and other neurological issues, including delirium.

“When we first encountered the virus, the focus was on how it attacked the respiratory system,” says Dr. George.
“A lot of the time it’s going through that respiratory system but what’s happening is that after it attacks the respiratory system, it starts to go into the brain, go into the kidneys, it goes throughout the body.”
As more has been learned about the virus, so, too, has the CDC expanded the list of symptoms to include issues caused by infections that reflect the wide-ranging effects it can cause: loss of taste or smell, diarrhea and headaches.
Another way the virus affects the body, says Dr. George, is by making the blood very thick which can lead to strokes.
One study from the UK found that 57 out of 125 patients experienced an ischaemic stroke while 39 presented symptoms of “an altered mental state.”
And strokes caused by coronavirus infections have been detected in younger patients, causing alarm given that the latest surge of positive coronavirus cases have been driven by patients under the age of 40.
“This doesn’t necessarily mean that younger patients will experience these symptoms,” says Dr. George, “but it still has to be taken seriously, especially since younger patients represent a larger portion of new cases.”
“There’s still so much we don’t know about the virus,” he continues, “and these are serious, debilitating conditions that can have long-lasting health effects even if someone ‘recovers’ from the virus.”
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WTVF) — Studies show most people recover from COVID-19 but there's also many who are still battling symptoms weeks, sometimes months later.
Now, there is a new way for long-haulers to get help here in Nashville.
Vanderbilt University Medical Center has started what's called the Adult Post-Acute COVID Clinic, a place where people who still have lingering symptoms can go for help.
In order to be admitted, a patient must have a tested positive for COVID-19 at least four to six weeks earlier.
Some of the most common symptoms people are experiencing long term can vary from fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, joint pain and chest pain.
In some rare cases, some can experience kidney problems, hair loss and even have trouble focusing.
SO, HOW DOES THIS WORK?
There's a number you can call that will connect you to a nurse, and your responses will determine if you need to see an internist or specialist either in person or virtually.
Since post-acute COVID syndrome can vary from person to person, the clinic has a team of specialists from a variety of fields to help best treat these lingering symptoms.
Anyone can call (888)-312-0847 seven days a week from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Vanderbilt says you don't need a referral from a clinician.
You can call the clinic directly to talk with a nurse and schedule an appointment.
The White House said President Donald Trump and the first lady are exhibiting mild symptoms of the coronavirus after announcing on Friday that they tested positive for the virus.
"The president does have mild symptoms and as we look to try to make sure that not only his health and safety and welfare is good, we continue to look at that for all of the American people.
He continues to be not only in good spirits but very energetic," White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters.
First lady Melania Trump later tweeted that she is "overall feeling good.
"
Meadows told reporters that doctors are continuing to monitor the health of the president and first lady.
Despite his diagnosis, Meadows said Trump is "staying committed to working very hard on behalf of the American people.
"
"We have a president that is not only on the job, will remain on the job, and I'm optimistic that he'll have a very quick and speedy recovery," Meadows added.

The New York Times first reported that the president was experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, citing two people familiar with his condition.
A source told the Times that Trump was experiencing cold-like symptoms and another person who attended his New Jersey fundraiser on Thursday said Trump seemed lethargic.
Mabel has opened up on her ongoing health battle (Picture: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images)
R&B singer Mabel has revealed that she has been living with glandular fever for two years – after initially mistaking her symptoms for Covid.
The pop star, 26, started feeling unwell during the first few months of 2020, describing herself as feeling constantly tired with a sore throat.
Her symptoms then began affecting her singing voice which led her to believe, after Covid hit the headlines, she had been struck down by the virus.
However, her symptoms didn’t clear up as expected, and she soon discovered she had glandular fever, which is a common infection among teenagers and young adults.
The most common symptoms include a high temperature, a painfully sore throat, swollen glands in your neck, severe fatigue – which can last for months after the infection has disappeared – aching muscles and chills and sweats
‘I kept thinking that I had
Covid [but] all my PCR tests came back negative,’ the Finders Keepers said.
‘It turns out I have a strain of glandular fever that I’ve had for over two years.
She was worried it would affect her performances (Picture: David M. Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images)
‘So when I’m tired and I’m stressed I get glandular fever.
And I still have it.
I did a test the other day.
It’s still there.’
After living with the illness for so long, the singer, daughter of 80s pop sensation Neneh Cherry, has admitted that she became fearful about future performances and was worried about her career.
She added to MailOnline: ‘I’d become completely obsessive about [social media comments].
I was going on to stage in complete and total utter fear – scared that people are going to say bad things and “You’re not performing to your best ability”.
‘And then it becomes a catch 22 because people say terrible things, and you’re like “I kind of agree with you, that wasn’t a great performance”.’
With new album About Last Night… on the way, the singer has insisted that her ability to deal with her illness is greatly improved in 2022, and that she now takes time to look after herself so as to not worsen her condition – crediting horse-back riding and meditating twice a day with helping her get back on her feet again.
About Last Night… is out in July.
New single Overthinking is out now.

Measuring the data
This analysis was based on 305,997 responses to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey (CIS) collected over the four-week period ending 2 January 2022, weighted to represent people aged two years and over living in private households in the UK.
Self-reported long COVID was defined as symptoms persisting for more than four weeks after the first suspected COVID-19 infection that were not explained by something else.
Parents and carers answered survey questions on behalf of children aged under 12 years.
Date of first (suspected) COVID-19 infection was taken to be the earliest of:
date of first positive test for COVID-19 during study follow-up
date of first self-reported positive test for COVID-19 outside of study follow-up
date of first suspected COVID-19 infection, as reported by the participant
Those with an unknown date of first (suspected) COVID-19 infection are in the estimates for "any duration" but not in duration specific estimates.
The definition of self-reported long COVID in this release is consistent with that used for "Approach 3" in our technical article on the prevalence of post-acute symptoms 4 or 12 weeks after COVID-19 infection.
The estimates in this release are expressed out of everyone in the population; in contrast, the denominator for the estimates in our technical article is the number of infected people in the study sample.
A further difference is that this analysis is based on confirmed and suspected COVID-19 infections, whereas the estimates in the technical article include only laboratory-confirmed cases.
The focus of this analysis is the population prevalence of self-reported long COVID.
For data on the impact of long COVID, see results from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey and the Schools Infection Survey.
The strengths and limitations of this analysis are described in a previous release.
The survey questions relating to self-reported long COVID can be found in Section F of the enrolment and Section D of the follow-up CIS questionnaires.
See Tables 2a to 2f of the technical datasets accompanying the latest Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection Survey statistical bulletin for survey response rates.
Narcolepsy is a rare condition that can cause a person to fall asleep without warning.
Researchers are still studying the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the COVID-19 vaccine on narcolepsy.
Share on Pinterest Tang Ming Tung/Getty Images Narcolepsy is a rare, long-term brain condition that prevents a person from regulating sleep and waking patterns.
Although it does not cause long-term physical health problems, it can affect an individual’s day-to-day life.
Research indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic may have affected these symptoms according to people’s home and work routines.
This article discusses what research says about possible links between narcolepsy and COVID-19 and the effects of the COVID-19 vaccine on this condition.

Overview of narcolepsy Narcolepsy often results from a person having low levels of the brain chemical hypocretin, also known as orexin.
There are two types of narcolepsy: type 1 and type 2.
Symptoms Narcolepsy symptoms can vary from person to person and may develop over several years or weeks.
Everyone diagnosed with the condition will experience daytime sleepiness, but only 10–25% will experience all other symptoms.
Symptoms of narcolepsy include: Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS):
This is the most common symptom and causes excessive sleepiness, regardless of how much sleep the individual gets at night.
This is the most common symptom and excessive sleepiness, regardless of how much sleep the individual gets at night.
Sleep attacks: This is where a person falls asleep suddenly and without warning and is a common symptom of narcolepsy.
This is where a person falls asleep suddenly and without warning and is a common symptom of narcolepsy.
Cataplexy:
A sudden temporary muscle weakness or loss of muscular control that triggers due to strong emotional reactions.
Typical symptoms include: slurred speech facial drooping legs collapsing
A sudden temporary muscle weakness or loss of muscular control that triggers due to strong emotional reactions.
symptoms include: Hallucinations and sleep paralysis: Sleep paralysis is a temporary inability to move or speak while falling asleep or waking.
It usually only lasts a few seconds, and hallucinations may accompany it.
People can quickly recover their movement following an episode.
A person can take stimulants, such as amphetamine, to help keep them awake, or sedatives, such as barbiturates, to help them sleep.
Lifestyle adjustments, such as keeping a regular sleep pattern and avoiding smoking and alcohol before bed, can also help ease symptoms.
Narcolepsy symptom management and COVID-19 pandemic A 2021 study mentions that during the COVID-19 pandemic, people did not report worsening narcoleptic symptoms after discontinuing narcolepsy medication due to quarantining difficulties.
This is down to their ability to have more naps during the day, delaying their rise time and an increased sleep duration at night, improving their symptoms naturally.
A 2022 study further corroborates these findings, suggesting that extended sleep time, circadian delay and teleworking decreased symptoms of central hypersomnias.
Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic Participants of this 2021 study found that their routines underwent drastic alterations by quarantining.
This led to an increase in symptoms, such as: cataplexy
sleep paralysis
nocturnal awakenings
sleepiness As a result, their sleep and wake times changed, resulting in altered sleeping patterns.
Additionally, people in the same study took fewer antidepressants but more stimulants.
However, this 2021 study found that participants who worked from home could manage their daytime sleepiness better, allowing themselves more naps and gaining an increased nocturnal sleep time.
However, participants who continued their usual working schedule experienced more frequent nocturnal awakenings.
The COVID-19 pandemic stunted people’s ability to follow a routine through the use of quarantine.
This study shows that routine is important to ensure a good quality of life for those with narcolepsy.
Working from home during the pandemic improved some people’s routines as they could better regulate their sleeping patterns.
Contracting COVID-19 and narcolepsy
According to a 2021 study , genetic susceptibility to narcolepsy and environmental exposures to bacterial and viral infections may alter or trigger a reaction in a person’s immune system.
This may attack the orexin-producing neurons, which help regulate a person’s sleep and wake pattern.
The study further suggests that the inflammatory response due to infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, may trigger chronic autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders.
These infections can initiate specific conditions in susceptible individuals, such as Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and narcolepsy.
Narcolepsy and the COVID-19 vaccine Experts have not undertaken any large-scale genome-wide association study on vaccination responses of those with narcolepsy for routinely used vaccines.
However, in this 2021 study , a woman with a history of hypersomnia presented with EDS after having the COVID-19 vaccine.
The study found that relapse may have links to an autoimmune mechanism.
Therefore, more studies are necessary to protect vulnerable individuals from the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine.
Similarly, the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009 saw associations of the H1N1 vaccine with a several-fold elevated risk of developing narcolepsy in children and young adults throughout Sweden, Finland, and Denmark.
According to this 2020 article , the link between H1N1 response, vaccination, and narcolepsy highlights an important multidisciplinary healthcare opportunity.
Further studies are therefore necessary to draw more definitive conclusions.
The second wave of the pandemic has added some new complications of coronavirus to the list, ‘Rectal bleeding’ is one of them.
The main cause of rectal bleeding was said to be due to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.
There can be many reasons for rectal bleeding in patients affected with Covid-19.
The common reasons are haemorroids, anal fissures and intestinal bleeding due to diverticulosis etc.
Although diarrhoea can be a significant symptom of Covid-19 infection, a significant proportion of patients develop constipation.
This could be due to poor appetite and intake of food or liquids and reduced mobility.
Common causes for rectal bleeding like hemorrhoids are aggravated due to constipation.
Blood thinning medications that are used to prevent clots in the lungs can also enhance bleeding.
What is CMV – Cytomegalovirus?
CMV or cytomegalovirus is a common virus.
This virus rarely causes a problem in healthy people, but can have severe effects on people with a weak immune system.
The body retains this virus for a lifetime once infected.
CMV mainly spreads from one person to another through bodily fluids like saliva, blood, urine, semen and breast milk.
There is no cure, but the symptoms can be managed by medications.
CMV affects people only with a weak immunity and the majority of the people who get affected remain unaware.
Symptoms of CMV can be described as fever, sore throat, muscle aches, fatigue.
This virus spreads quickly in areas that have a lot of young children such as nurseries or day care centers.
A CMV infection can spread to a person through contact with eyes, nose or mouth after coming in contact with the bodily fluid of an infected person.
How has the virus affected people with Covid?
If a person who is Covid positive or post recovery has abdominal pain or traces of blood in their stool, should be assessed by a doctor.
The cases that were reported so far complained of lower gastrointestinal bleed and with intestinal obstruction.
Infections like Covid and the medications used to treat it tend to suppress the immunity of patients and make them susceptible to uncommon infections that have varied presentations.
Infections like CMV, mucormycosis and white fungus are opportunistic infections that affect people with weak immune systems, as it was earlier seen in immunocompromised patients such as patients affected with cancer or HIV positive people .
CMV is present in 80 – 90 % of the Indian population which presents clinically asymptomatic due to the inherent immunity which makes it strong enough to appear asymptomatic.
Early diagnosis and an effective treatment with antiviral drugs (injections and tablets) can help Covid-19 patients that have developed the CMV infection.

On Sunday night, news came down that Philadelphia Eagles head coach Doug Pederson had tested positive for COVID-19, one day before his players were expected to be on the field together for the first time this summer.
Obviously, trying to start a professional sports season, especially one that features over 100 players and coaches intermingling, amid a pandemic isn't without its hurdles.
After all, in the last week we've seen Major League Baseball held hostage after an outbreak in the Marlins clubhouse.
And now, football will try to follow in baseball's footsteps while avoiding some of the same pitfalls that have made many question if sports should even be played right now.
Several NFL players have already been placed on the special Reserve/COVID list, including a trio of Eagles.
And now, their head coach is also unable to participate in the workouts he's scripted as he's currently quarantined (away from his family) in his New Jersey home.
But the positive test hasn't dampened Pederson's spirits, as the head coach believes the protocols in place around the NovaCare Complex are enough to keep players safe inside the building.
It's about the things they do outside the building, which is where Pederson believes he contracted the virus, that will be most important.
With assistant head coach Duce Staley now running training camp practices on the field, Pederson took a few moments out on Monday afternoon to speak to members of the Eagles media and discuss his positive test, how the team is adapting without their head coach, what comes next for the Birds and much more.
Here's a full transcript of Pederson's session with the media, starting with his opening statement...
* *
*
DOUG PEDERSON: "First of all, listen, I appreciate everyone's well-wishes.
[I] had a lot of text messages, phone calls the last 24 hours or so.
And, listen, I know this virus affects people differently, and I'm very respectful and mindful of that, and I also want everybody to know that I feel great,
[my] energy level's high, and really no symptoms whatsoever.
I'm very fortunate because I do know and understand that this virus attacks people a little bit differently.
I've been in great communication, constant communication, not only with our medical team and doctors, but also my staff and the team itself.
And I can still control — I think one of the things that I've learned this offseason is I can still run the team virtually, and that's what I have been able to do today, even yesterday, holding staff meetings, things of that nature, team meetings.
"I also want to reiterate the fact that I'm very comfortable and confident that the protocols we have in place at NovaCare are for the best interest of the football team and all those that enter that building, and it still is a very safe environment.
And one of the things that we all need to learn and I need to learn, taking away from this, is obviously we need to protect ourselves when we're in the community away from the building, continue to wash our hands, wear our masks, do the social distancing that the medical teams and doctors have prescribed.
"Obviously, we're taking this very seriously around our building and in our everyday lives, and again, we need to continue to do so.
So, we understand that things like this are going to happen, and I've been able to talk with my staff about contingencies, not only with players but also with staff members.
I mentioned, I believe last week when we got together about this, that I'm not going to speculate on a timetable for me.
I treat it just like players, so I'm not going to speculate on that.
When I'm back, I'm back.
"
It sounds like you know you contracted this outside the complex.
Are you pretty confident that's the case, and what gives you that sense?
PEDERSON: "Listen, and respectfully I'm going to say this one time and I'm going to leave it at that.
This is something that I don't necessarily want to comment on for myself or speculate on for anyone else, obviously.
I'm just going to reiterate the fact that I feel good about the safety of our building and the protocols we have in place.
That's one thing that I do know, and obviously going through this has reinforced that for me at this time.
"
Talking to players yesterday, they said that your message to them was that it's not about one guy.
When we talk about the contingency plans for the players, what is your message to them now?
PEDERSON: "That's been my message really all offseason since we went virtual back on March 12th or 13th.
The message still is, obviously we have to protect ourselves, not only in and around the building, but outside as well.
But you know what, the thing is too, it's never been since I've been in Philadelphia about one guy or one group of guys or whatever.
It's been about everybody.
This year's no different.
"Obviously I'm fortunate that this is happening at this time of our season, of our training camp, at the beginning and not necessarily say in October or November where you could miss games.
It's a matter of just protecting each other, and our goals don't change, obviously.
We're going to continue to press forward one day at a time.
"
Does Duce Staley now take on a bigger role inside the building?
And what is going to happen with that kind of structure?
PEDERSON: "I do everything I can virtually.
I just finished up a bunch of player meetings, group meetings this morning already.
Guys are getting ready for a walkthrough on the field.
And, yeah, Duce being the assistant head coach, he just assumes my role with the day-to-day activities inside the building.
He and I talk every single morning.
I give him, through communication with him, I give him my thoughts on where I'm leading, what I'm thinking, and then he carries that message forward.
He's done a great job so far and will continue that going forward.
"
Are you quarantining from the rest of your family?
PEDERSON: "I'm quarantining away from my family, so I'm making sure I keep my distance from them and, you know, wear my mask, wash my hands, do those things while I'm here at home.
"
You said last week that there are contingencies for everyone in the organization.
How much thought had you put into this possibility and does this change how you're going to plan those contingencies going forward?
PEDERSON: "Great question.
For me, I have thought a lot about the contingencies, and this doesn't just happen.
Actually, I thought about this quite a bit over the summer, if something like this were to come up not only with me but with any of my staff or any of the players.
And this is why I feel really good about my staff, the guys I have in place to carry the torch so to speak in somebody's absence — and, of course, it's my absence at this time.
And the same with the players, you know?
I guess you treat it just like if a guy were to get hurt and they're going to miss some time.
You've got to have the next guy prepared and ready to go and this is no different.
"
We were talking to some of your late-round picks yesterday, is this a bad year to be a late-round pick?
PEDERSON: "Number 1, I think that this is actually a good time to be a late-round pick and possible a free agent, even these young draft picks.
And the reason I say that is because we've already had a week with them on the grass, and they're going to get some really good opportunities here in these next couple of weeks.
They're going to learn a lot from the veterans.
The way I've got the schedule set up is for them to learn and be successful, and then once we get into the padded portion of training camp is where we really get to see where these guys are.
"So when you have an opportunity like this, for all of us in coaching, it's about coaching everybody up.
It's not just about the starters and getting them prepared, which we do every year, but now it's more about getting these young guys — because we really feel like it's going to be these young guys that are going to help us throughout the entire season.
"
This weekend we saw two starting QBs end up on the Reserve/COVID list.
We've talked about it before but have you given any thought to the possibility of quarantining a quarterback, just given the importance of that position?
PEDERSON: "Yeah, it's unfortunate that that happens, and I think we know that these things are going to happen probably throughout the course of the season.
If it happens, you hope it happens early enough that you don't get to the regular season.
But [these are] conversations that are still ongoing with my staff and offensive guys on staff — you know, Press
[Taylor],
Rich [Scangarello] and Marty [Mornhinweg], those guys — and haven't decided on anything yet.
But it is something to consider as we move forward.
"
Doug, what rules do you have in place for players when they leave the building?
PEDERSON: "Obviously, I mean, it's typical training camp.
We have curfew at 11 [p.m.] at the hotel.
The days are filled — we're on a 12-hour workday with the players — and there's not a lot of time at the end of the day.
Listen, once they leave the building, they're on their own.
"And it's up to me and my staff and the trainers and the doctors to educate them on the protocols outside the building.
This is just a great time for me to be an ambassador and be a leader and really educate our team on how to protect ourselves outside the building.
"
The Saints sequestered a part of a hotel to kind of control the traffic coming in and out.
Have you guys discussed that at all?
PEDERSON: "As you know, we use the Courtyard Marriott down at the Navy Yard as our team hotel during training camp, and these are all things that were negotiated between players and management, and we've actually given the veteran players, who have homes here, the option to stay at the hotel or stay at home — that's part of the agreement.
And listen, everybody's situation is different.
Everybody wants to protect their families, obviously, and I understand that, so we do give them that option to decide.
"
You've been following the protocols and all, and you still got the virus, so does that give you any more worry about the NFL successfully completing a season?
PEDERSON: "My confidence hasn't changed at all.
I'm extremely optimistic that we're going to play, I'm confident that we're going to play.
It's unfortunate though.
Like I told my team last night, this virus holds no prejudices, right?
It doesn't matter, it can affect any one of us.
And I'm sure many of you have had family members or loved ones or people you know affected by this virus, so that part of it doesn't matter.
We've got to just abide by the protocols, they're in place for a reason, obviously, for our safety.
Our building is a great place to be.
It is a safe place to be for our players and coaches and all who are involved.
So I'm looking forward
[to it].
It's full-steam ahead for me.
Obviously, I'm itching to get back in the building at some point and be around our players and get these guys ready for the season.

A long-awaited study that zeroes in on the most common groups of symptoms for people with long Covid may not bring the relief millions of Americans and doctors have been wanting.
The study, some of the first research from the National Institutes of Health’s billion-dollar RECOVER program, does not provide a standardized definition of the condition.
Researchers say it is a first step in identifying "common language" for scientists working toward treatments for the condition.
"I think that the amount of science that's going to come after this is going to be an avalanche," said study author Dr. Leora Horwitz, a professor of population health and medicine at New York University Grossman School of Medicine, as well as the director of the Center for Healthcare Innovation and Delivery Science at NYU Langone Health.
The new study, published Thursday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, looked at data from 9,764 adults in the RECOVER trial, which has been recruiting participants since last year.
The vast majority, 8,646 people, had previously been diagnosed with Covid.
While hundreds of symptoms possibly associated with long Covid have long been reported — mostly through anecdotes from patients — the new study homes in on 12 of the most common.
Long Covid symptoms include:
Ongoing fatigue.
Brain fog.
Dizziness.
Thirst.
Cough.
Chest pain.
Heart palpitations.
Abnormal movements.
Upset stomach.
Lack of sexual desire.
Loss of smell or taste.
Feeling sick or overly exhausted after physical activity, also known as post-exertional malaise.
The aim of the paper is not to limit the definition of long Covid to these 12 symptoms only.
It's meant to focus future research into those symptoms as scientists work to figure out how long Covid affects the body in so many different ways.
It also includes a scoring system that can be tailored to each patient based on the severity of their symptoms.
"This is a tool that can be used to identify people with long Covid for the purpose of doing more research," said Andrea Foulkes, the principal investigator of the RECOVER Data Resource Core, as well as the director of biostatistics at Massachusetts General Hospital, which is part of the Mass General Brigham hospital system.
"The significance of that is that we can then begin to unravel the mechanisms for each of those different manifestations.
And then of course, ultimately, the goal is to identify treatments," Foulkes said.
But the paper, anxiously anticipated by people who still have long Covid symptoms and the physicians who treat them, has raised some criticism.
"I think people will be underwhelmed by a 'landmark' paper that is describing the presence of symptoms that people have long known are a problem," said Jim Jackson, the director of Behavioral Health, ICU Recovery Center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, and author of "Clearing the Fog: From Surviving to Thriving With Long Covid—A Practical Guide.
"
"This isn't a paper that offers any solutions, that offers any therapeutics.
And that's desperately what people want: hope in the form of treatments," Jackson said.
What is brain fog?
There needs to be more specificity with describing the symptoms, Jackson said, taking issue with the vagueness of the term "brain fog.
"
"What exactly does brain fog mean?
If we call it a brain injury, then there's a treatment path.
We know how to treat brain injuries," Jackson said.
"We do cognitive rehab.
If we call it brain fog, what on earth do you do with that?
"
Horwitz added some clarity during an interview.
Brain fog, in these cases, includes having to read something several times to understand it, having trouble keeping appointments that aren't part of a weekly routine, and difficulty following complex directions.
Another term "abnormal movements," was also vague.
During interviews with NBC News, RECOVER researchers were unable to further define what patients meant by "abnormal movements" as a symptom.
"The finding is a new one and requires further study," Foulkes said.
"When someone walks into my office, and I'm trying to screen them or discuss with them whether they have long Covid," said Dr. Hugh Cassiere, director for critical care services at South Shore University Hospital, part of Northwell Health in New York, "you've rendered that useless as a symptom to me because you can't define it.
"
Neither Jackson nor Cassiere were involved with the RECOVER trial.
Recruiting for long Covid treatment trials
The research also found that long Covid patients who were unvaccinated were more likely to have severe symptoms, as well as people who were infected before the omicron variant took hold.
They also found that some symptoms tend to cluster together: post-exertional malaise and fatigue for example, or fatigue, dizziness, brain fog, upset stomach, heart palpitations and post-exertional malaise all together in other cases.
Researchers said they expect to start enrolling long Covid patients in clinical trials for treatments this year.
"We don't want to forget about these people as we move into different phases of pandemic," said Tanayott Thaweethai, another study author and associate director of biostatistics research and engagement for MGH Biostatistics.
"We want to be really thoughtful about how we study them, how we try to understand what's happening in their tissue in their bodies.
All of this takes time in understanding such a complicated chronic disease," Thaweethai said.
As of April, 15.1% of the more than 100 million Americans with Covid had long-term symptoms, according to a government survey.

Another detainee has died in detention after suffering symptoms of the coronavirus.
Khaled Taha, 58, died at the Haram Police station as a result of a stroke and pneumonia.
His release was ordered on 8 July after he paid his bail, but he was never actually released.
His death follows a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) released last week which documented that at least 14 detainees had died of suspected coronavirus in Egypt across ten facilities since mid-July.
Of these 14 deaths, nine died in hospital and three of them were transferred just hours before they died.
The report criticised the insufficient medical care, lack of symptom screening and testing for the virus currently in place in Egypt’s prisons.

HRW called on Egyptian authorities to take “immediate steps to provide everyone in detention with adequate medical care.”
The Geneva-based Committee for Justice has documented more than 190 cases of coronavirus in 12 prisons and 29 police stations.
Rights groups have consistently appealed to the government to release political prisoners to ease overcrowding.
The unhygienic prison cells that are full beyond capacity are fertile breeding grounds for the spread of the virus.
With COVID situation stabilising and authorities withdrawing the curbs, people have started returning to normal life.
However, it is to be noted that COVID is not over yet and with several variants circulating, including recombinant strains, the chances of catching the virus again cannot be ignored.
So, in case you are suffering from cold-like symptoms, then don't take it too lightly, because it can be Omicron.
It is to be noted here, experts have pointed out that patients catching Omicron usually report flu-like symptoms due to their vaccination status or immunity acquired from previous infections.
And, the common notion that the Omicron variant is mild might be a ‘myth’.
8 Omicron symptoms that are similar to cold or flu…
Cough, runny nose, fatigue, sore throat, headache, muscle pain, fever and sneezing - are the 8 Omicron symptoms that are flu-like.
As per a study published in infectious disease and epidemiology journal, Eurosurveillance, quoted by Independent, people who have been vaccinated can suffer from these 8 flu-like symptoms in case they catch Omicron.
The study also said that cough, runny nose and fatigue were among the most common symptoms in the vaccinated individuals while sneezing and fever were least common.
How to distinguish symptoms?
The best way to understand the difference is through the severity of the symptoms.
In case it is cold, you might feel mild discomfort in your throat, while for COVID, you may suffer from other signs like fever, cough, fatigue, body pain, gastrointestinal symptoms and loss of smell and taste.
These symptoms are unlikely if you just have a cold.
Plus as per, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the incubation time for COVID-19 ranges from 1-14 days, most commonly being around 5 days.
For Omicron, experts say it's shorter i.e. 3 days.
However, for a normal cold, it is typically between 1 and 3 days.
How to know whether it is Omicron or flu?
In case you are suffering from these symptoms, you must get yourself tested, or self-isolate until the symptoms persist.
This will only help curb the spread.
According to the UK's ZOE symptoms study app, here are the symptoms that could indicate the presence of Omicron in the body.

Medical workers tend to a COVID-19 patient at a hospital in eastern France in 2020.
Obesity is one of several conditions that researchers have linked to an increased risk of developing long COVID.
From the start of the pandemic, patients and doctors alike have been frustrated by the sizable minority of coronavirus infections that turn into long COVID, a perplexing collection of lingering and often disabling symptoms that persist weeks, months or years after the initial infection subsides.
The condition has been reported in both children and adults; in those who had preexisting conditions and those in robust health; in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and those who experienced only mild symptoms during their initial infection.
A new study from researchers at USC offers some insights into the prevalence of long COVID and suggests some early clues for who might be more likely to develop long-term symptoms.
Advertisement
The study, published this month in Scientific Reports, found that 23% of people who had coronavirus infections between March 2020 and March 2021 were still reporting symptoms up to 12 weeks later.
Researchers recruited roughly 8,000 people, some infected and some not, to answer biweekly questions about their overall health and COVID-19 status.
By the end of the yearlong survey period, they had a sample of 308 people who had gotten the disease at some point in the year.
After filtering out respondents with symptoms such as headache and fatigue prior to infection as a result of unrelated conditions like seasonal allergies, the team found that nearly 1 in 4 COVID-19 sufferers were still grappling with symptoms 12 weeks after becoming infected.
“These people are not able to do necessarily all the activities they would want to do, not able to fully work and take care of their families,” said Eileen Crimmins, a demographer at USC’s Leonard Davis School of Gerontology and a coauthor of the study.
“That’s an aspect of this disease that needs to be recognized, because it’s not really as benign as some people think,” she said.
“Even people who have relatively few symptoms to start with can end up with long COVID.”
Determining who is at greater risk for long COVID has proved a challenge to demographers and healthcare providers.
Several previous studies have identified women as being at greater risk.
But the USC study found no relationship in its sample between long COVID and age, gender, race or preexisting health conditions including cancer, diabetes, hypertension and heart disease.

It did note a higher risk in patients who had obesity prior to infection.
And it also spotted some associations between specific symptoms people experienced during their initial infection and the likelihood of developing long COVID.
Patients who reported sore throats, headaches and, intriguingly, hair loss after testing positive were more likely to have lingering symptoms months later.
“Our assumption is that that hair loss reflects extreme stress, potentially a reaction to a high fever or medications,” Crimmins said.
“So it’s probably some indication of how severe the illness was.”
Because it covered only the first year of the pandemic, the study doesn’t account for two major developments: vaccines and variants.
None of the COVID-19 patients in the sample were eligible for vaccines during the study period, and all were infected before the Alpha variant from the U.K reached U.S. shores.
While the study’s 308 respondents were representative of the population, no snapshot of a few hundred people can tell the whole story of the roughly 200 million people in the U.S. who have had the virus, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“The authors made a commendable effort to identify factors associated with long COVID,” said Dr. Alain Lekoubou Looti, a neurologist at Penn State University who was not involved with the study.
“However, these factors may need to be confirmed in larger samples.”
The most common long COVID symptoms reported were headache, nasal congestion, abdominal pain, fatigue and diarrhea.
But the study did not address many of the symptoms people living with long COVID describe as the most debilitating, said Hannah Davis, a co-founder of the Patient-Led Research Collaborative, a research group that focuses on the condition.

“We need work like this, but this work also indicates they aren’t very familiar with what long COVID is,” Davis said.
“The list of symptoms are predominantly acute COVID symptoms and don’t include the most common symptoms of post-exertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction, memory loss, sensorimotor symptoms and others.”
Defining long COVID presents a challenge to those attempting to track or treat it.
COVID-19 is a chimerical beast — symptoms evolve as the condition drags on, and can vary widely among patients.
The fluidity of long COVID makes it hard to gauge its prevalence.
Various studies have placed the percentage of people reporting enduring symptoms 12 weeks after their initial infection at anywhere from 3% to 50%.
“We need a universal case definition before we can really understand the prevalence of long COVID.
Right now, the definition varies wildly across studies, leading to a big range in prevalence estimates,” said Jana Hirschtick, an epidemiologist with the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health.
“After all this time, we still don’t have a clear picture of who is at greatest risk.”
The absence of strict diagnostic criteria is also a major issue for patients attempting to seek treatment.
At the moment, long COVID is considered an “exclusionary diagnosis,” meaning one that is given only after all other valid possibilities have been ruled out, said Melissa Pinto, an associate professor of nursing at UC Irvine who studies the condition.
In the U.S., that can mean a long and expensive process of submitting to various tests and specialists.
For many long COVID patients, 12 weeks is just the beginning of a months- or years-long ordeal.

“I’ve known people that have had this now for 2½ years,” Pinto said.
“There’s no safety net, really, for these individuals.”
Headache, runny nose, scratchy throat?
Such symptoms are the mainstay of many common winter illnesses, but early reports from South Africa that these – and/or a dry cough, body aches and night sweats – have been observed in some of those infected with the new Omicron variant, have prompted speculation that SARS-CoV-2 might be evolving to cause milder illness.
“We are seeing patients present with dry cough, fever, night sweats and a lot of body pains.
Vaccinated people tend to do much better.”
Meanwhile, in the UK, where Omicron cases are currently doubling every two days, Prof Tim Spector, the researcher behind the ZOE COVID Symptom Study app – which collects daily data on people’s symptoms, infection and vaccination status – has claimed that Londoners who have common cold-like symptoms are currently more likely to have COVID-19 than a cold.
Omicron has now overtaken Delta as the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in London.
Reassuring as such reports may sound, they are based on very little data, as in most cases it takes several weeks after infection for severe symptoms to develop.
It is also possible that symptoms differ depending on a person’s vaccination status, and/or whether they have recovered from a previous COVID-19 infection.
Situation updates
In its latest situation report, published on 14 December, the WHO said: “The data on the clinical severity of Omicron remains limited.
More information on case severity associated with Omicron is expected in the coming weeks due to the time lag between an increase in the incidence of cases and an increase in the incidence of severe cases, and deaths.”
Even if Omicron does turn out to trigger milder illness in the majority of those it infects, if it is significantly more transmissible this could still result in health services being overwhelmed, as some people will become seriously unwell and require hospitalisation.
Early symptoms
Media reports that Omicron is associated with milder illness stem from comments made by several South African doctors in late November:
At a briefing organised by South Africa’s Department of Health on 29 November, Unben Pillay, a family doctor practising on the outskirts of Johannesburg, said that while it was still early days, “We are seeing patients present with dry cough, fever, night sweats and a lot of body pains.
Vaccinated people tend to do much better.”
Another Pretoria-based family doctor, Angelique Coetzee said many her patients had presented with unusual symptoms, especially severe tiredness, and none had reported loss of taste or smell.
These early reports have since been supplemented with preliminary data from Omicron outbreaks in several other countries.
Documented outbreaks
For instance, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health has investigated an Omicron outbreak that occurred during a Christmas party in Oslo on 26 November.
Of the 111 participants its officials interviewed, 80 (73%) were subsequently diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, and 17 had been confirmed as infected with the Omicron variant, as of 8 December – although genomic analysis of samples was ongoing, and it was assumed that Omicron would be implicated in most cases.
Here, 70% of infected individuals reported cough, lethargy, headache, and sore throat, and more than half reported fever.
Most of the participants were aged between 30 and 50 years and had received their second vaccine dose between May and November 2021, so it is unclear how older, or unvaccinated individuals would fare.
None of these individuals had been hospitalised, as of 9 December.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also reported on the characteristics of 43 Omicron cases that it has investigated so far, finding that the most commonly reported symptoms were cough, fatigue, and a blocked or runny nose.
Fifty-eight percent of these cases were in individuals aged 18 to 39 years, and 79% were in people who had received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.
One vaccinated patient was hospitalised for two days, and no deaths had yet been reported – although the time between symptom onset and death for COVID-19 ranges from two to eight weeks.
Hospitalised patients
How symptoms will play out for unvaccinated individuals is still unclear.
Data from the ZOE COVID Symptom Study has previously suggested that COVID-19 symptoms tended to be similar between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, although those who had been vaccinated usually reported fewer symptoms over a shorter period of time, suggesting that they were experiencing milder illness and recovering more quickly.
However, this was before the emergence of Omicron.
Meanwhile, in South Africa, hospital admissions for COVID-19 have steadily increased across all states since late November, with early reports suggesting that unvaccinated individuals accounted for the majority of such admissions.
Whether Omicron is really associated with milder symptoms remains to be seen.
But given the sharp rise in cases around the globe, we should soon find out: hospitalisations tend to track several weeks behind infections, and COVID-related deaths several weeks behind that.
Until we know more, experts advise caution.
Omicron appears to be highly transmissible, so masks, physical distancing, good hand hygiene and ventilation are more important than ever.
But ensuring as many people as possible have access to COVID-19 vaccines remains our best shot at preventing the spread of Omicron, as well as any other SARS-CoV-2 variants that may follow it.
You wake up one morning with nausea and diarrhea.
It gets worse throughout the day.
You think you may have a stomach bug, but it's hard to know for sure.
Maybe it's COVID-19 or even food poisoning?
"Nausea and diarrhea are symptoms that can have a number of causes that include COVID-19, the stomach flu or food poisoning," says Ashley Barajas, FNP, Nebraska Medicine nurse practitioner.
"Determining the exact cause early on is not always that cut and dry.
"
Barajas helps explain the differences between these three common problems that can cause gastrointestinal problems.
COVID-19-related diarrhea and nausea
"Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are less common symptoms of COVID-19, but when they do occur, they tend to be some of the first symptoms you will experience," says Barajas.
"There is no definite way to tell early on what is causing your symptoms, however, diarrhea caused by COVID-19 tends to be more watery, yellow or green in color and may be accompanied by cramping and bloating.
If you have COVID-19, you will likely develop other symptoms within a day or two such as fever, cough, congestion and/or loss of taste and smell.
"
If it's COVID-19, how long am I contagious?
If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, you are usually contagious up to five days from the start of symptoms.
If you are still having symptoms after five days, stay away from others until your symptoms are gone, says Barajas.
Stomach flu symptoms
What is often called the stomach flu actually isn't the flu at all.
The real name for the stomach flu is called gastroenteritis.
Gastroenteritis can be caused by viral, bacterial or parasitic infections, but is commonly caused by the norovirus.
These infections cause inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract which decreases the body's ability to absorb and digest food, explains Barajas.
The food moves so quickly through the GI tract that the acids the body secretes to break down the food, don't have time to do their job, resulting in diarrhea.
While the stomach bug is often called the 24-hour flu, most viral GI symptoms last between 24 to 72 hours, says Barajas.
Is stomach flu contagious?
Gastroenteritis is contagious through fecal matter or saliva.
To help reduce infecting others, close the toilet lid before flushing, clean the bathroom and toilet frequently and wash your hands thoroughly and frequently, says Barajas.
Food poisoning symptoms
Food poisoning may be suspected if you have eaten out or traveled recently.
Food poisoning is caused by eating food that has been contaminated by bacteria, viruses or parasites.
Symptoms typically develop within 12 to 36 hours and can last up to 72 hours.
Blood in the stool is also an indication that you may have food poisoning caused by bacteria and should be evaluated urgently.
Is food poisoning contagious?
Individuals experiencing food poisoning can be contagious through fecal matter or saliva for up to 48 hours.
To reduce transmission to others, follow the same suggestions as gastroenteritis: close the toilet lid before flushing, clean the bathroom and toilet frequently and wash your hands thoroughly and frequently, says Barajas.
How to treat an upset stomach at home
To help reduce the severity of symptoms, whether it's caused by COVID-19, a GI virus or food poisoning, Barajas recommends using over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medications that will help slow down the motility of the GI tract.
You can also take over-the-counter medications that will help reduce gas and bloating.
Barajas also suggests switching to a clear liquid diet such as juice, broth or popsicles; or a bland diet with foods such as bread, rice or applesauce, depending on what your stomach is able to handle.
Learn more about what to eat with an upset stomach.
"It is extremely important that you do the best you can to stay hydrated," says Barajas.
"Diarrhea can cause you to lose a lot of water and electrolytes, which can lead to dehydration.
"
What if I'm pregnant or nursing?
Staying hydrated is even more important if you are pregnant to avoid dehydration and nutrient deficiency.
Both can put undue stress on the fetus.
If you are nursing a baby, dehydration will reduce your milk supply, notes Barajas.
When to get help from a doctor
In most cases, you can let GI issues run their course, says Barajas.
However, if you become extremely dehydrated, develop sunken eyes, high fever or blood in your stools, you should make an appointment to see your doctor.
"In the case of gastroenteritis or food poisoning, you may have a pathogen that requires additional antibiotic treatment," says Barajas.
About 2 million people in the UK have persistent symptoms after COVID infection, termed long COVID.
Commonly reported long COVID symptoms, such as fatigue and shortness of breath, have a significant effect on people’s daily activities, quality of life and capacity to work.
But long COVID symptoms are much broader than this.
In a new study published in the journal Nature Medicine, we identified 62 symptoms associated with long COVID.
We also explored some of the factors linked to an increased risk of developing long COVID.

Much of the initial work undertaken to understand long COVID has been among people who were hospitalised, but most people infected with COVID have been managed in primary care.
We therefore know relatively little about long COVID in people with typically milder initial infections.
In our study, we analysed electronic primary care records from more than 450,000 people in England with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID, and 1.9 million people with no prior history of COVID, from January 2020 to April 2021.
We matched both groups very closely in terms of their demographic, social and clinical characteristics.
We then assessed the relative differences in the reporting of 115 symptoms to GPs.
For those who had COVID, we measured this at least 12 weeks after they were infected.
We found that people who had been diagnosed with COVID were significantly more likely to report 62 symptoms, only 20 of which are included in the World Health Organization’s clinical case definition for long COVID.
Some of these symptoms were expected, like loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath and fatigue.
But some of the symptoms that we found to be strongly associated with COVID beyond 12 weeks were surprising and less well known, such as hair loss and reduced libido.
Other symptoms included chest pain, fever, bowel incontinence, erectile dysfunction and limb swelling.
These differences in symptoms reported between the infected and uninfected groups remained even after we accounted for age, sex, ethnic group, socioeconomic status, body mass index, smoking status, the presence of more than 80 health conditions, and past reporting of the same symptom.
We also found that younger age, female sex, belonging to certain ethnic minority groups, lower socioeconomic status, smoking, obesity, and a wide range of health conditions were all associated with a higher risk of reporting persistent symptoms more than 12 weeks after COVID infection.
A group of conditions
Given the breadth and diversity of long COVID symptoms reported in surveys, long COVID is unlikely to represent a single condition, but rather a group of distinct conditions that occur as a consequence of COVID infection.
Exploring how long COVID symptoms are different in different groups could help scientists understand the different disease processes in the body that cause long COVID.
Our analysis suggests that long COVID can be characterised into three distinct groups based on clusters of symptoms reported.
The largest group, consisting of roughly 80% of people with long COVID in our study, faced a broad spectrum of symptoms, ranging from fatigue, to headache, to pain.
The second largest group, representing 15%, predominantly had mental health and cognitive symptoms, including depression, anxiety, brain fog and insomnia.
The third and smallest group, capturing the remaining 5%, had mainly respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough and wheeze.
Where to from here?
We were only able to assess symptoms reported during GP consultations.
Of course, not everyone will report symptoms to a doctor, so our study was restricted to comparing the differences in symptoms reported between people with and without a history of confirmed COVID.
It’s also possible some patients in the comparison group had COVID, but either didn’t get tested or didn’t notify their GP.
Nonetheless, our research validates what people with long COVID have been saying right through the pandemic about the breadth and diversity of their symptoms.
It also reinforces that their symptoms cannot simply be attributed to other factors such as existing health conditions, or the effects of stresses related to living through the pandemic.

To support the millions of people in the UK and around the world afflicted with the chronic health effects of long COVID, doctors and researchers need comprehensive tools to capture the symptoms of long COVID, to provide the best care.
Patients with long COVID need tailored health services which recognise that long COVID is not a single condition but a diverse group of overlapping conditions needing individualised care.
Meanwhile, we need clinical trials to evaluate potential treatments targeting the spectrum of long COVID symptoms, which could hopefully improve the quality of life for people with long COVID.
An Australian-led research team has uncovered the first genetic link to strong immunity against Covid-19, which may help to explain why some people never develop any symptoms of the illness.
A person who carries one copy of the protective HLA-B15 gene is twice as likely to remain asymptomatic after infection with the Sars CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19, while someone who carries two copies of the gene is eight times more likely to have no symptoms, the research, published on Thursday in the journal Nature, found.
In a joint statement the lead authors of the paper, La Trobe University’s Prof Stephanie Gras and Dr Dimitra Chatzileontiadou, told Guardian Australia that while most global efforts have focused on understanding factors underlying severe Covid-19 illness, examining asymptomatic infection is also important.
It can help scientists understand how the immune system can rapidly clear the virus in some individuals, allowing them to remain healthy despite infection.
“Our results may lay the groundwork for refinement of vaccine development and therapeutic options,” they said.
While about 10% of people without the HLA-B15 gene had no symptoms after contracting the virus, this rose to between 20 and 30% in those with a copy of the gene, increasing their protection at least twofold.
The researchers found that individuals with a particular HLA-B15 gene protein have T-cells (a type of white blood cell that helps protect against disease) that can recognise a part of the Sars CoV-2 spike protein that is similar to other seasonal coronaviruses which cause the common winter cold.
This is known as cross-reactivity.
A virologist and associate professor at the University of New South Wales’ Kirby Institute, Stuart Turville, said: “Many of us would have had a seasonal coronavirus before and those with this gene would have educated a T-cell population during this past infection.”
“So their T-cells would be ready for battle, so to speak, once Sars CoV-2 turned up,” Turville said.
The HLA-B15 gene protein is an important factor because “unlike antibodies, the T-cells cannot see or bind to the virus particle and need HLA proteins to determine how to respond to an infection”.
The research is part of a global study including the University of California, San Francisco, which is using data from almost 30,000 registered bone marrow donors in a voluntary program to track Covid-19 infections and symptoms.
Of 1,428 unvaccinated donors with positive test results for Covid-19, 136 had no symptoms.
Turville said it was “really clever” to use the bone marrow program because it allowed the researchers to track a large population and look for any genetic makeup that may be important for immunity against viruses.

“What’s also interesting is that HLA proteins are different across a population, enabling some of us to be better equipped to take on a virus we see,” Turville said.
“Some people with certain HLAs control HIV infection really well, referred to as ‘elite controllers’.
But this doesn’t mean in general if you have this protein you can fight off all viruses as well.
Curiously, other studies have shown this specific protein is associated with poor progression with hepatitis C, for example.”
The head of the Garvan Institute’s immunology and immunodeficiency laboratory, Prof Stuart Tangye, said it was important to note there were many factors influencing susceptibility to Covid-19 symptoms and genetics was just one of them.
Not everyone with HLA-B15 will be symptom-free.
“This research is a nice extension of previous work done on cross-reactivity, and it helps to further explain asymptomatic infection in some people, but not all people,” Tangye said.
The NHS has updated its official list of Covid symptoms, adding nine more signs of possible coronavirus infection.
The UK recognised just three Covid symptoms for the first two years of the pandemic; a new, continuous cough, fever and a change to or loss of sense of taste and smell.
It updated this list after the Government ended the provision of free Covid tests, and following long-term pressure from researchers to do so.
Here is the full list of official symptoms, and whether itchy skin can be a sign of Covid-19.
What are the official Covid symptoms?
The NHS now lists the following as official Covid symptoms:
High temperature or shivering (chills) – a high temperature means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do not need to measure your temperature)
New, continuous cough – this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours
Loss or change to your sense of smell or taste
Shortness of breath
Feeling tired or exhausted
Aching body
Headache
Sore throat
Blocked or runny nose
Loss of appetite
Diarrhoea
Feeling sick or being sick
The NHS says: “The symptoms are very similar to symptoms of other illnesses, such as colds and flu.”
Both the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the US have had longer symptom lists for some time.
Professor Tim Spector, lead scientist of the Zoe Covid-19 symptom tracker app, wrote on Twitter after the list was expanded: “NHS official main symptoms of coronavirus have finally changed after two years of lobbying and Zoe app user input – hurrah!
“Pity they have the order wrong – but it’s a start and could help reduce infections.
thanks
Zoe loggers!”
He had previously criticised the Government’s refusal to expand the list of symptoms.
Can itchy skin be a Covid symptom?
The NHS does not list itchy skin as an official symptom of Covid-19.
However, data from the Zoe tracker app has shown that changes to the skin, fingers, toes, mouth and tongue can be linked to coronavirus.
According to Zoe data, rashes affect nine per cent of people with the illness.
“Some of the less well-known symptoms of Covid-19 include characteristic Covid rashes, ‘Covid fingers and toes’ as well as other rashes.
‘Covid tongue’ and mouth ulcers are less common but can also be a sign of infection,” the Zoe website states.
It adds: “Covid-19 rashes are usually itchy and this may lead to poor sleep.
Some people with rashes also experience sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) light, getting red patches on their face after being outside for a short period of time.”
Rashes either tend to be reported as small areas of itchy red bumps, usually starting around the elbows and knees, as well as the back of the hands and feet, or raised bumps on the skin which come and go quite quickly over hours.
“This rash is extremely itchy and often starts with intense itching in the palms or soles, and can cause swelling of the lips and eyelids,” Zoe says.
It adds that there are other, less common, rashes associated with Covid including Pityriasis Rosea-like light-sensitive rashes affecting the face or neck.
Vasculitis rashes, when small blood vessels in the skin become damaged, are also seen in severe cases of Covid that need hospital support.
They can sometimes be a symptom of long Covid, appearing weeks after the initial infection, after other symptoms have disappeared.
If your rash is very itchy, ask your GP for prescribed medications such as steroid creams to help alleviate the discomfort.
The COVID-19 outbreak is a global tragedy.
Hundreds of thousands have died, healthcare systems are buckling, and the future is uncertain for millions of people whose livelihoods are collapsing.
It is absolutely right that the focus today is on saving lives here and now.
In the same spirit of doing what we can to safeguard people’s wellbeing, we must not content ourselves with containing the acute crisis.
We must also look ahead to what we can learn from this crisis to prevent future risks.
COVID-19 is a reminder of how vulnerable even our modern, technologically advanced societies are.
The biggest lesson is that COVID-19 is more than an illness.
It is a symptom of the ailing health of our planet.
Humanity’s dysfunctional relationship with nature has caused this wider disease.
Understanding this root cause is critical, if we want to rise stronger after the crisis.
COVID-19 is a zoonotic virus—meaning it spilled over from wild animals to humans—and evolved into a pandemic due to the now well-established risk cocktail of the 21st century: ecosystem destruction, species loss, global warming, colliding with risky human behavior like illegal wildlife trade.
All of this has played out in a globalized network of trade and travel.
COVID-19 is not an isolated event.
Research shows that 60% of all known infectious diseases in humans and 75% of all emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic.
As we move into natural habitats, and exploit ever more wildlife, contact between humans and disease-carrying species increases.
Zoonotic diseases aren’t the only symptom of poor planetary health.
Climate change is an even more serious crisis; it potentially poses existential risks for future generations, and is already having real-time impact on millions globally, for example through extreme weather events such as cyclones and floods.
Changes in climate have a multiplier effect, leading to other problems, from ecosystem stability to food production and human conflict.
Ecosystem and biodiversity loss are threatening the planet’s ability to provide goods and services –deforestation for example, disrupts our weather patterns and the water cycle, contributes to climate change, and destroys the habitats of important species.
Chemicals and waste are polluting the air, soil and water, killing millions each year.
All of these symptoms make clear that the planet’s health, and therefore our health, is deteriorating rapidly.
And nature, just like a human, can only take so much before things reach the point of collapse.
We have known for a long time that we face a climate crisis and an ecological crisis.
And now we are in the midst of another crisis, a tightly interconnected pandemic.
It is not enough to focus only on economic recovery.
Building resilience based on a whole-system approach is fundamental.
This means the protection and sustainable management of our global commons—such as our atmosphere and the earth’s rich diversity of plant and animal species—must be center-stage of priority-setting in our societies.
This year was meant to be a “super year for nature,”—the world was due to agree on a global plan to protect and restore biodiversity beyond 2020.
The next global climate meeting was scheduled to take place in Glasgow, with natural solutions to climate change a key issue for discussion and countries expected to propose new commitments to lower their emissions, in line with the Paris Agreement.
The international community was also due to set out a framework for better management of chemicals and waste.
COVID-19 has made it crystal clear that we must deliver on these agendas.
They are the means to form a blueprint for an economic and societal future that factors nature into everything we plan and build, from homes to cities to food systems.
But we cannot effectively address common global concerns, such as the environment, individually.
The spread of this virus has proven once and for all that, in this globalized world, there are no local problems—pollution and pathogens know no borders.
Faced with the multifaceted impacts of COVID-19, multilateralism has to evolve.
Governments, businesses, the UN, international organizations, scientists and individual citizens need to unite as a single global community to safeguard people from avoidable risks.
After COVID-19, nothing will be the same.
But life can be better.
We have had a moment to think and reflect.
Perhaps we don’t need as much stuff as we thought we did.
Perhaps we can fill our lives with closer relationships, with moments, with creativity.
Perhaps we recognize what really counts in our lives: being safe and being free.
When we overcome COVID-19, we should not risk what we have won.
We should do what we can to stabilize our environment, our support system.
We need to think about how we can restore nature by living life differently.
One thing is clear.
We cannot just develop a vaccine for COVID-19, call it “job done” and rev the economic engines back into the red.
We need to use the reboot to incentivize sustainable innovation and green investment.
The credits and subsidies that many governments are handing out so generously in this moment are not just a necessity—they are also a chance to direct economic progress towards sustainable development.
This is an important insurance policy to avoid future pandemics.
To stabilize the climate, we have the Paris Agreement on keeping global temperature from rising more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels.
This translates into reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.
For biodiversity and ecosystem stability, we need a similar binding target to halt the loss of biodiversity.
Of course, setting targets alone does not do the job.
Governments must work hard to achieve them.
However, we have an important window right now, thanks to the bailout programs and financial stimulus packages arising from the COVID-19 crisis.
Coupling science-based targets on climate and nature with these recovery mechanisms is a key strategy we need to deploy now, to win twice: we build resilience against future shocks and we create healthier economies.
Because investing in sustainability is not something we do for nature or for the climate.
We do it for us.
COVID-19 can affect babies if they get an infection with the novel coronavirus.
While COVID-19 tends to be less severe in children, this protection does not extend to babies, who may be as vulnerable to severe illness as older adults.
A Chinese analysis that included more than 2,000 children with COVID-19 found that 10.6% of infants under 1 year of age had severe or critical symptoms.
All of these infants survived, but a small number of infants in the United States have died following diagnosis with COVID-19.
Knowing the symptoms of COVID-19 in babies and young infants can help with early diagnosis and treatment.

Complications Babies with COVID-19 can develop severe complications, such as: sepsis, a type of systemic infection that can damage the organs
organ failure, especially of the kidneys
shock
heart failure
hypoxia, which happens when the body cannot get enough oxygen, potentially damaging the brain and other organs Doctors do not yet know if there are long-term risks associated with having COVID-19.
Some children have developed a type of severe inflammation following COVID-19.
This syndrome is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) .
Doctors may also refer to it as pediatric multi-inflammatory syndrome (PMIS).
A related condition called Kawasaki disease also causes inflammation and potentially life threatening complications.
Some warning signs of severe inflammation include: intense stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea
high fever
rash
bloodshot eyes
chest pain or pressure
exhaustion
When to see a doctor There is no cure for COVID-19, and all treatments are currently experimental.
For babies and children with mild-to-moderate symptoms, the disease usually resolves within a few weeks.
However, it is important to make contact with a doctor if a child develops any symptoms of COVID-19.
A doctor can refer the child for testing and provide advice on which symptoms to monitor.
Following a diagnosis with COVID-19, parents or caregivers should call a doctor if the baby’s symptoms suddenly get worse after improving or they develop any of the following symptoms: signs of respiratory distress or trouble breathing
signs of organ problems, such as an irregular heartbeat or decreased urination
a rash
changes in consciousness, such as constant sleeping or signs of confusion
inability to breastfeed or eat
sunken eyes or lethargic behavior In most cases, a baby with these symptoms will need care in the hospital.
If the baby is very ill or the doctor does not immediately answer the phone, go to the hospital.
Wear a mask or another protective face covering and keep the baby away from other patients.
If a baby appears to recover from COVID and later develops a rash or other unusual symptoms, call a doctor.
These symptoms could warn of MIS-C.
Treatment and prevention There is no cure for COVID-19.
Instead, doctors focus on treating the symptoms.
In some cases, this might mean hospitalizing the baby to monitor them.
The baby might also need intravenous fluids, oxygen treatment, or, rarely, a ventilator.
Breastfeeding babies may need pumped breast milk through a feeding tube if they are unable to eat on their own.
Learn more about COVID-19 treatments here.
People can reduce the risk of a baby getting COVID-19 by: avoiding going out in public with the baby as much as possible
limiting or banning visitors
washing the hands every time anyone in the house comes into contact with another person
washing the hands before eating and after using the bathroom, coughing, or touching packages, mail, or any other surfaces that a person outside the household may have touched
disinfecting surfaces such as doorknobs and changing tables regularly
wearing a mask or other face covering when out in public
practicing physical distancing when contact with people outside the household is necessary
quarantining anyone in the household who gets sick in one room and frequently disinfecting any surfaces that they touch Learn more about preventing COVID-19 here.
Update, April 29:
The CDC has updated its guidelines to include chills, muscle pain, sore throat, headache, and a new loss of taste or smell as symptoms of Covid-19, in addition to fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
So you’re not feeling well, and you’re afraid you might be infected with the new coronavirus disease, Covid-19.
Given that the United States now has more confirmed cases than any other country, and more are popping up, that might be a reasonable suspicion.
Health officials are ramping up the response measures, advising people to stay at home as much as possible.
Several states and cities have now imposed more severe measures like lockdowns and stay-at-home-orders to contain the virus.
But cases of Covid-19 are following an exponential growth trajectory in the US.
That means that the number of infections is rising rapidly in proportion to the number of people infected.
You may have been exposed if you have traveled to a region with novel coronavirus transmission or if you’ve been in close contact with someone who has Covid-19, something that’s becoming harder to avoid without social distancing.
And some people spreading the virus may not show any symptoms at all.
Here are some signs you may have the illness:
The World Health Organization, based on its research in China, reports the illness can present in different ways, ranging from no symptoms at all to severe pneumonia.
Some symptoms are more frequently seen than others.
Based on confirmed cases in China, the WHO says 88 percent of infected people experienced a fever and 67.7 percent had a dry cough.
Less frequent symptoms include thick mucus from coughs (sputum) (33.4 percent), shortness of breath (18.6 percent), sore throat (13.9 percent), and headache (13.6 percent).
It’s likely, however, that many infected patients with very minor or no symptoms were not captured by this study, which would mean their symptoms (or lack thereof) were underrepresented in those statistics.
“Covid-19 disease usually begins with mild fever, dry cough, sore throat and malaise,” writes Megan Murray, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard Medical School, in an FAQ for the Abundance Foundation.
“Unlike the coronavirus infections that cause the common cold, it is not usually associated with a runny nose.”
These symptoms emerge five or six days after infection on average, but can show up in as little as a day or as much as two weeks after exposure.
Doctors and researchers have also found some other symptoms associated with Covid-19, though they haven’t been recognized as diagnostic criteria by the WHO or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
A recent, yet-to-be-published German study found that some Covid-19 patients can present with the symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection, similar to the common cold: runny nose, congestion, and sneezing.
(The study involved a very small number of patients, however.)
In a study of 204 Covid-19 patients, researchers in China found that half of patients experienced gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
The American Academy of Ophthalmology reported that Covid-19 can present as conjunctivitis, causing red or pink, itchy eyes.
Using a Covid symptom tracker app for smartphones, researchers in the United Kingdom recently found that a peculiar loss of taste or smell had strong links to testing positive for Covid-19.
Some researchers now say that anosmia, a loss of the sense of smell, and ageusia, a loss of the sense of taste, should be considered Covid-19 symptoms.
These symptoms can precede others by several days so they can be an early warning sign of infection.
If you have symptoms, what should you do?
The CDC advises people to seek medical attention immediately if they have trouble breathing or emergency warning signs like persistent chest pain, confusion, and bluish lips.
People with symptoms in one of the high-risk groups — those who are over 65 years old; people with diabetes, hypertension, or preexisting breathing problems; or people being treated for cancer — should quickly seek medical advice or treatment.
Call your health care provider before heading to a clinic if you suspect you may have Covid-19.
That way, the clinic can take appropriate precautions for your visit.
If you’re not in a high-risk group and have symptoms, mild or severe, you should also call a health professional — a doctor, a nurse, or a public health official.
They will work with your local health department and figure out whether you need to get tested or get treatment.
And make no mistake: While older people face the highest risks, all age groups can get sick from Covid-19, so everyone needs to take precautions and pay attention to their symptoms.
Doctors and health officials advise not to go to the emergency room if your symptoms do not appear to be life-threatening.
Also, don’t panic.
Most people who get infected get better, often on their own with just rest, fluids, and fever medication.
If you are advised to stay home, there are several other measures you should take, according to the CDC.
The most important step is to avoid exposing other people to the illness, especially in the early stages of symptoms, when the disease is most contagious.
That means staying home from school or work, avoiding public transit or ride-hail services, and separating yourself from the people and animals in your home.
It also means avoiding sharing household items like towels, dishes, and bedding.
Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue over your mouth and nose.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
Clean the surfaces in your home that you come into contact with regularly, like counters, doorknobs, bedside tables, keyboards, and phones.
“It is possible that some of the viral particles ... end up on surfaces (door handles, subway poles, coins) where they might remain viable,” Murray writes.
When leaving your home, wear a surgical face mask if possible to avoid spreading the virus if you’re sick.
Officials are urging the public not to buy N95 masks because they are needed by health workers and are in short supply.
But other face coverings can be used, and the CDC has recommended cloth masks for everyone in certain public settings.
All the while, pay close attention to your symptoms.
Call your health care provider if your symptoms get worse.
If you have a health emergency and need to call 911, let the dispatcher know that you may have Covid-19 so responders can prepare.
And everyone, with or without symptoms, should observe social distancing guidelines.
That’s because infected people can spread the virus to others, even without experiencing symptoms themselves.
These steps may seem tedious, but remember that they serve to protect not just you but also the people around you.
Controlling an outbreak is everyone’s job.

VIRAL TIMELINE How coronavirus symptoms progress day-by-day – from a fever to breathlessness
COVID-19 has been around for over a year now and has caused millions of deaths across the globe.
Some people will have no symptoms at all while others can suffer severely and scientists have produced a day-by-day breakdown of the typical Covid-19 symptoms - to help people better understand the nature of the disease.
⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news & updates
4 Scientists have produced a day-by-day breakdown of the typical Covid-19 symptoms
A study from Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, outlined how Covid-19 progresses - with fever, fatigue and shortness of breath all developing at different times.
The analysis includes adults with Covid-19 admitted to Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital.
It's important to note that a third of coronavirus cases have no symptoms at all.
The government launched free rapid testing across the UK for people with no symptoms - this is so that the virus has less chance of spreading unknowingly.
But if you have any of the three key symptoms, a high temperature, loss of taste and smell or a new persistent cough you should get a PCR test.
There are also conditions such as long Covid.
This is when a person has had Covid and got over the intial virus - but still suffers debilitating symptoms months on.
Here, with the help of this study, we take you through the coronavirus symptoms timeline.
4 Many people suffering with coronavirus symptoms will feel tired
Day 1
For most people, the first symptoms will be fever (temperature above 37.8C) and/or cough, which is usually dry to start with.
Despite this, Dr Sarah Jarvis, GP and Clinical Director of Patientaccess.com, adds: "Muscle aches and pains and feeling generally very tired are also common.
"Sore throat and blocked nose are less common and runny nose or sneezing less common still.
"
And in a study carried out in Wuhan, of 138 patients, about ten per cent of people experienced diarrhoea and nausea a couple of days prior to development of fever.
Developing these symptoms does not necessarily mean you have the illness and they are similar to other illnesses, such as the common cold or flu.
Some people will not develop all of these symptoms - and some might not even show symptoms at all, experts say.
4
Day 5
A team of researchers who studied 138 patients with Covid-19 at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University found that on average it took five days for people to develop signs of breathing difficulties - from displaying the first symptoms.
Patients who are usually older or have a pre-existing health condition are normally the people who experience difficulty breathing – known as dyspnea.
Signs that a person is experiencing dyspnea include shortness of breath, feeling smothered or suffocated, tightness in the chest, rapid, shallow breathing, heart palpitations and wheezing.
Day 7
As Dr Jarvis says, "For most people, most symptoms will have settled within a week.
"
About 85 per cent of people diagnosed with coronavirus will see their symptoms start to diminish by day seven.
4
From the remaining 15 per cent who don't see their symptoms diminish and are showing signs of dyspnea - they tend to be admitted to hospital on day seven.
Day 8
Patients with severe cases tend to develop signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) at this point.
According to the NHS, this is a life-threatening condition where the lungs can't provide the body's vital organs with enough oxygen.
ARDS occurs when the lungs become severely inflamed due to an infection or injury and the inflammation causes fluid from nearby blood vessels to leak into the tiny air sacs in your lungs, making breathing increasingly difficult.
Symptoms of ARDS can include severe shortness of breath, rapid, shallow breathing, tiredness, drowsiness or confusion and feeling faint.
15 per cent of cases reach this point, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
Day 10
Patients with worsening breathing problems tend to be entered into an intensive care unit at day ten.
The Wuhan study also said it observed that the average hospital stay was ten days.
Day 12
By day 12, fever – an early sign of Covid-19 – would typically end around this point.
However, a cough associated with the illness may stay around for longer, the scientists found.
In fact, 45 per cent of the 191 patients who were looked at still had a cough on discharge after the 12 day period.
WHAT IS LONG COVID At the start of 2020 Covid-19 was new and unknown to most of the world and experts say there is still much that needs to be understood about the virus.
Speaking to The Sun, Dr Ben Littlewood-Hillsdon, chief medical officer of symptom assessment tool Doctorlink said one aspect of Covid-19 which is yet to be fully understood is its longevity.
"Firstly, it’s important to know that ‘long-Covid’ is not an official medical term, but a colloquial term being used to describe people whose symptoms go on for longer than the two-week symptom period officially recognised by WHO.
"As with the acute stage of the disease, the long-term symptoms are still far from being fully understood.
"
WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?
Here are the main symptoms of long Covid: - Hair loss - High temperature - Diarrohoea - Exhaustion - Chest pain - Insomnia - Hallucinations - Covid toes - Chills - Diorientation - Cognitive problems - Breathing issues - Muscle or body aches - A heart rate of more than 100 beats a minute - Vomiting
Day 13
Dyspnoea – shortness of breath – tends to cease after about 13 days for those who survive and continue until point of death for those who didn’t.
Day 18
From illness onset, the average time to death was 18.5 days.
However, the developments and use of different treatments such as dexamethsone have helped get patients out of hospital.
Day 22
The average time to discharge was 22 days.
There are now three vaccines being rolled out across the UK to help prevent infections from coronavirus.
Jabs from Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna have been given out to millions of Brits.
Antibiotics do not help, as they do not work against viruses - only bacteria.
The NHS says that treatment aims to relieve the symptoms while your body fights the illness.
Those who are infected will need to stay in isolation away from other people until they have recovered.

At this point, many of us recognize the hallmark symptoms of a Covid infection: an aching throat, a clogged nose, a persistent cough and an overwhelming sense of blah.
But lying awake at night, during the peak of sickness or in the weeks or months following an infection, some people discover another downside: They can’t sleep.
“We see it all the time,” said Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, the chief of research and development at the V.A. St. Louis Healthcare System.
Here’s why Covid can be so disruptive to your sleep, along with tips for getting enough rest.
Why Covid affects sleep
One theory is based in biology: In some people with Covid infections, the virus may be able to get into the hypothalamus — a key part of the brain for regulating sleep, said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco.
Any area of the body that the virus enters, it can inflame, he said; any part that gets inflamed tends to function less well.
This means that even if people linger in bed for eight hours, they may not be getting deep, restorative sleep, Dr. Al-Aly said.
After his second hospitalization for acute Covid-19, Tony Marks expected to get better.
Then pain invaded the 54-year-old software executive’s arms and legs.
At first, he felt like he was covered by deep bruises, although nothing was visible on his skin.
These days, he told me, he feels like he’s being beaten repeatedly with a baseball bat.
Pain is increasingly being recognized as a key feature of what is commonly called long Covid, in which symptoms persist after the acute phase of the viral infection ends.

In a recent study from Italy, for example, one-third of Covid long-haulers had symptoms of fibromyalgia or widespread muscle or bone pain.
Other research links Covid-19 to neuropathic pain — often described as burning, stabbing, or feeling like electrical shocks — that results from damage to the nervous system.
Pain, which also includes headache, ranks among the top symptoms of long Covid in large longitudinal studies.
Yet the medical establishment has been sluggish in acknowledging and treating the pain that people with long Covid experience.
For those of us who already live with persistent pain, delayed action is nothing new.

One day in 1994, as a 30-year-old working in my office at the U.S. Department of Justice, my back began to burn.
It felt as if acid were eating my spine.
Suddenly, muscles from my feet to my neck tensed like cable wire; my whole body seized up and I fell from my chair to the floor.
For many years after that, I was largely bedridden and extremely limited in my ability to sit, stand, or walk.
It took three years of slogging through the health care system in search of a cause — nerve conduction tests suggested multiple sclerosis while bone scans indicated ankylosing spondylitis — before my disability was identified as stemming from a surgical mishap.
But for many people, the search for the source of chronic pain lasts far longer than that.
Health research professor Dania Palanker, a patient advocate I work with at the National Pain Advocacy Center, waited 28 years for an accurate diagnosis that explained the pain she had suffered since childhood.
Diane Talbert, another patient advocate, had her life-long pain tied to a severe form of psoriatic arthritis — 25 years after her psoriasis was discovered at age 6.
Imagine waiting a quarter century for answers — or worse, never getting them at all.
One reason that persistent pain can go undiagnosed for so long is that health care workers are undereducated about diagnosing and treating pain.
In addition, while research into understanding persistent pain has improved, our nation’s investment in it still falls far behind other widespread, consequential, and costly conditions.
In 2020, NIH-funded research on chronic pain totaled $689 million.
That sounds like a lot of money until it’s compared with cancer or brain diseases, which received more than ten times that amount.
The investment also pales when you consider that persistent pain now costs the U.S. as much as $700 billion each year in health care expenses and lost productivity.
Even before the pandemic, 50 million Americans — that’s 1 in 6 of us — lived with daily pain, significantly more than live with cancer, diabetes, or heart disease.
For almost 20 million Americans, the pain is so extreme that it is effectively disabling, regularly preventing them from engaging in the most basic activities or in work.
Long Covid is now adding a whole new group of people to the chronic pain population.
Eight months after his positive test for Covid, Tony Marks told me, “Nothing touches my pain.
Nothing.”
In my work as an advocate for people in pain, I hear familiar themes when talking to those newly adjusting to life with pain from long Covid.
Many feel misunderstood by family, friends, and employers; some have lost jobs but have been denied Social Security and other benefits.
Tony Marks had to step down from his executive position, but his employer accommodated him in a job with less responsibility.
I too was able to continue working in the years before surgical innovation restored my mobility.
But not everyone is so fortunate.
Many people I’ve spoken with have had to stop work altogether.
Getting to the root of why pain is misunderstood is complicated.
Pain has been stigmatized for centuries.
The idea that it is ordained by a higher power, or that those who suffer deserve it, is reflected in “poena,” the Latin word for pain, which means penalty or punishment.
And many people — including many clinicians — don’t understand the difference between acute and chronic pain.
Everyone experiences acute pain, which is adaptive and necessary, alerting us to danger or teaching us to seek care or rest.
Chronic pain, in addition to impairing a person’s quality of life, actually harms the body: it can damage nearly every organ system.
For this reason, many experts consider it to be a disease in its own right.
Pain is also invisible, making it possible for others to be unaware that someone is experiencing it or to even doubt or deny its existence.
This invisibility, and the fact that the experience of pain is subjective, means that how doctors treat pain often depends, at least initially, on how those who suffer describe their pain.
Not everyone’s account of their pain is given equal weight or credence.
Health care providers, for example, often rate the pain of Black people as being less severe than that of their white counterparts.
And women reporting pain in medical settings are more likely to have their pain discounted than men.
Suspicions about pain have also grown amid the overdose crisis attributed to opioid overprescribing, but it’s a mistake to conflate the corporate actions of Big Pharma and the unethical actions of some prescribers with the problem of pain itself.
The good news for the newcomers with long Covid chronic pain is that early intervention can help prevent pain from progressing from acute to chronic and from chronic to disabling.
But that makes their concerns urgent; providers must listen to and treat them now.
The World Health Organization has released a clinical definition of long Covid, which specifies common symptoms along twelve domains, and includes joint and muscle pain, headache, and neuralgias, among others.
In the U.S., doctors on the front lines of treating this new disease have rightly called for a national crisis management plan for Covid long-haulers.
Addressing pain, which is so often neglected in the U.S. health care system, must be a central part of this crisis management effort.
And for the rest of us with non-Covid chronic pain, the U.S. needs a better infrastructure for assessing, diagnosing, and treating pain, as well as investing more research dollars into identifying and understanding the causes of chronic pain.
Also needed: better insurance coverage for the gold standard of pain management as it currently exists, which combines different kinds of treatment — including medications, interventional therapies like blocks or procedures, psychological therapies, physical therapies, and integrative techniques.
Access to such interdisciplinary care must be made available to more people suffering with chronic pain.
A chronic condition that affects more Americans than any other, and one that is growing amid a global pandemic, should no longer be disregarded.
It requires attention — stat.
Kate M. Nicholson is a civil rights attorney and the founder and president of the National Pain Advocacy Center, a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit that takes no industry funding and advocates for the health and human rights of people in pain.
Jim Parsons was one of the millions of people around the world to contract the coronavirus.
The 47-year-old Boys in the Band star revealed on Monday's The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon that he and his husband, Todd Spiewak, fought the disease earlier this year.
"Not everybody did [know we had it], but I figure why not talk about it with you on television?"
he quipped to host Fallon.
"Todd and I both had it early on.
It was, like, middle of March.
We didn't know what it was.
We thought we had colds.
And then it seemed less likely and then finally we lost our sense of smell and taste.
"
He said that losing his taste and smell was a particularly tough symptom to have in quarantine.
"It defied the descriptions for me.
I didn't realize how completely taste and smell could be gone," he said.
"And when you're in quarantine and there's really nothing to do but eat,
oh my god, that was brutal.
"
When Fallon asked if that meant he abstained from eating while suffering from that particular symptom, Parsons replied, "I ate everything.
I just didn't taste it.
It's the definition of wasted calories.
"
Prior to the pandemic, the actor wrapped a lengthy run as Sheldon Cooper on The Big Bang Theory.
"Yeah, it was weird," he said of the show ending.
"It's been really hard to decide what is Big Bang being gone and what's being now stuck in this weird time of quarantine.
The whole world is in this weird time.
The weirdest part for me was the way -- and I'm sorry if this sounds morbid -- but it reminds me of when someone dies or a pet passes and it feels so monumental in the moment and you think, well, this will never end.
And then one day you look up and you go, 'Oh, nine months have gone by.
OK, I guess life carries on.'
"
As for how his famous character would handle quarantine, Parsons quipped, "He was built for this.
This was the moment he was waiting for.

NATIONWIDE – The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is warning people that some symptoms of panic attacks could be mistaken for COVID-19.
What You Need To Know
Similar symptoms include shortness of breath/difficulty breathing and chills
Other symptoms can vary greatly
Professionals say pandemic will have negative impacts on mental health
According to a graphic posted on the department’s Facebook account Monday morning, some of the similar symptoms are shortness of breath/difficulty breathing and experiencing chills.
The post goes on to list other symptoms of both panic attacks and COVID-19, showing how the two can differ.
&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;
According to the National Institute of Mental Health, about 4.7 percent of adults in the U.S. experience some kind of panic disorder at some point in their lives.
Professionals have been predicting that the coronavirus pandemic will have a negative impacts on mental health of many Americans and anxiety disorders like panic attacks may be one of those impacts.
Around 5–10% of people who get infected with SARS-CoV-2 will experience symptoms that persist way beyond the initial acute period, a clinical syndrome we are learning more about, known widely as long COVID.
Shortness of breath, brain fog, lethargy and tiredness, loss of smell or taste are common features of long COVID, as is the development of new conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, depression and dementia.
But how long is the “long”?
If and when do symptoms resolve?
Baca juga: When does COVID become long COVID?
And what's happening in the body when symptoms persist?
Here's what we've learnt so far
A recent study has examined this in detail, following people for two years after their infection.
This and other recently published studies on long COVID show that while symptoms do resolve in many people, their resolution is slow and imperfect.
What did the study find?
The key work, led by Ziyad Al-Aly, examines the effect of SARS-CoV-2 two years after infection in a large group of US veterans.
The researchers followed 139,000 people with COVID and almost six million uninfected controls for two years, tracking deaths, hospitalisations and 80 long-term impacts of COVID, categorised into ten organ systems.
They found that people who were initially hospitalised with COVID were 1.3 times more likely to die and 2.6 times more likely to be hospitalised again, compared to the control group (people without COVID), over the two years.
After two years, this “hospitalised” group remained at increased risk of 50 conditions.
People who had milder COVID (who weren’t hospitalised with their initial COVID infection) had an increased risk of death for up to six months and increased risk of hospitalisation for up to 18 months.
However, at two years, they remained at increased risk of 25 conditions.
So, while people who were initially hospitalised for COVID had worse outcomes over the two-year follow-up, there was still a substantial burden of illness in people who initially had milder COVID.
This included a risk of clots and blood disorders, lung disease, fatigue, gut disorders, muscle and joint disorders and diabetes.
Findings from other recent research were similar
A separate cohort study followed more than 208,000 veterans with COVID over two years.
It showed that overall, 8.7% died compared with 4.1% in the uninfected control group.
The risk of death was concentrated in the first six months after infection.
A third, not yet peer-reviewed and smaller cohort study of 341 people with long COVID from Spain, found only 7.6% of them recovered at two years.

And how is it related to long COVID?
Another significant (not yet peer-reviewed) study from the United Kingdom assessed diabetes risk after COVID by following 15 million people in England from 2020–21.
It found a 30–50% elevated risk of new type 2 diabetes after COVID.
This increased risk persisted up to two years.
But the risk for type 1 diabetes risk did not persist.
An Australian (not yet peer-reviewed) study followed 31 people who developed long COVID and 31 matched controls who recovered from COVID for two years.
It found that most of the concerning immunological dysfunction effects that had been present at eight months, had resolved by two years.
While almost two-thirds of those with long COVID (62%) reported improved quality of life over the two years, one-third were still struggling in this regard two years after their infection.
Finally, a recent whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and biopsy study showed prolonged tissue level immune-activation and viral persistence in the gut for up to a remarkable two years after COVID.
These studies have some limitations
It’s important to note the observational studies have some inherent limitations.
The US veterans cohort studied by Al-Aly is nearly 90% men, with an average age of 61 years, which is different to groups most at risk of long COVID.
They acquired their initial infection in 2020, before Omicron, before vaccination and before therapies – all of which are protective against long COVID to a degree.
Having said that, long COVID still frequently occurs in vaccinated people infected with Omicron.
We still don’t have treatments for long COVID
Increasing understanding about underlying mechanisms of long COVID, such as those involving persistent virus and effects on mitochondria – the powerhouse of the cells - can lead to treatment options that need to be trialled.
In July 2023, the White House established the Office of Long COVID Research and Practice.
Two randomised trials are testing whether the antiviral nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) can treat long COVID are currently recruiting patients.
A separate randomised, placebo-controlled trial has shown that metformin, a commonly prescribed anti-diabetic medication, taken for two weeks (and taken within three days of testing positive for COVID) reduced the chance of developing long COVID by 41%.
The mechanism may involve an effect on mitochondria or directly on the virus.

But it’s still important to prevent COVID (re)infections
Taken together, these studies on the longevity of long COVID add substantially to the case to fast-track the development of interventions and therapies to prevent and/or cure the condition.
In the meantime, it’s crucially important to prevent (re)infections in the first place to reduce the future burden of long COVID, already estimated to be greater than 65 million people globally.
Breathe clean air by ensuring indoor spaces are well-ventilated.
In poorly ventilated or crowded spaces, wear a well-fitted and high-quality mask (a P2, KN95 or N95 mask), and/or use air filtration devices suitable for the space you are in.
Keep up to date with boosters.
And get tested so you can get antiviral treatment if you’re eligible.
If you suspect you have long COVID, discuss this with your GP, who may refer you to specialised services or multidisciplinary care.
PGA Tour updates health protocols, puts 3 players who tested positive for Covid-19 in same group

The PGA Tour announced Wednesday night it had updated its health and safety protocols, which will allow players who continue to test positive for Covid-19 but have met certain CDC guidelines to return to action.
For players and caddies who have tested positive for Covid-19 and were symptomatic, the Tour will follow a symptom-based model outlined by the CDC that allows them to return if they meet certain criteria: At least three days (72 hours) have passed since recovery (resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms) and at least 10 days removed from when symptoms first appeared.
This move is in accordance with the CDC’s Return to Work guidelines.
Studies have determined that the virus may no longer be present yet recovered players could still test positive, despite not being contagious.
That’s been the case this week with Dylan Frittelli, Denny McCarthy and Nick Watney.
“Out of an abundance of caution” during tournaments, the Tour will put any player or caddie who continues to test positive but met the aforementioned criteria as a single or grouped with other players who tested positive.
Frittelli, McCarthy and Watney have been grouped for the first two rounds of this week’s Workday Charity Open.
Their first round is at 9:13 a.m. ET off the 10th tee.
The Tour’s initial policy called for a minimum 10-day self-isolation period, and last week it added a test-based model for asymptomatic cases, allowing players or caddie who had tested positive to return if they had not had any symptoms and had two negative tests a minimum of 24 hours apart.
Whilst recovering from Covid you may continue to experience a dry cough for some time.
The NHS says if you have a cough, it's best to avoid lying on your back.
Instead, the health body suggests that those with a cough from coronavirus lie on their side or sit upright when not in bed sleeping.
Hair loss: The product that may cause hair to fall out in 'chunks'
The NHS adds: “To help ease a cough, try having a teaspoon of honey.
But do not give honey to babies under 12 months.
If this does not help, you could contact a pharmacist for advice about cough treatments.”
You should not go to a pharmacy if you have COVID-19 symptoms, and instead should try calling or contacting the pharmacy online instead.
The health body says a cough is usually a reflex action to clear dust, phlegm and other irritants from your lungs and windpipe.
It explains: “Over time, a cough can develop into a cycle, where excessive coughing causes irritation and inflammation, which worsens the cough.
A dry cough may have no obvious cause and using the advice below will help to prevent this cough.”
Symptoms of Covid-19 infection appear in 42 hours after being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 virus, much earlier than previously thought, finds a study.
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Covid symptoms take around five to six days to appear after infection.
But the study led by Imperial College London researchers showed that symptoms start to develop very fast, on average about two days after contact with the virus.
The infection first appears in the throat; infectious virus peaks about five days into the infection and at that stage is significantly more abundant in the nose than the throat.
The findings published on a pre-print server and not yet peer-reviewed also showed that the virus was detected first in the throat, significantly earlier than in the nose (40 hours in the throat compared to 58 hours in the nose)
The levels were lower and peaked sooner in the throat.
Peak levels of virus were significantly higher in the nose than in the throat, indicating a potentially greater risk of virus being shed from the nose than the mouth.
This highlights the importance of proper face mask use to cover both the mouth and nose, the researchers said.
The team also found that lateral flow tests (LFTs) are a reassuringly reliable indicator of whether infectious virus is present (that is, whether they are likely to be able to transmit virus to other people).
However, the LFT tests were less effective in picking up lower levels of virus at the very start and end of the infection.
"Our study reveals some very interesting clinical insights, particularly around the short incubation period of the virus, extremely high viral shedding from the nose as well as the utility of lateral flow tests with potential implications for public health," said Christopher Chiu, Department of Infectious Disease and the Institute of Infection at Imperial College.
In the trial, 36 healthy male and female volunteers aged 18-30 years, unvaccinated against Covid-19 and with no prior infection with SARS-CoV-2.
Participants were exposed to the lowest possible dose of virus found to cause infection, roughly equivalent to the amount found in a single droplet of nasal fluid when participants were at their most infectious.
Among the 18 infected participants, the average time from first exposure to the virus to viral detection and early symptoms (incubation period) was 42 hours, significantly shorter than existing estimates, which put the average incubation period at five to six days.
Following this period there was a steep rise in the amount of virus (viral load) found in swabs taken from participants' nose or throat.
These levels peaked at around five days into infection on average, but high levels of viable (infectious) virus were still picked up in lab tests up to nine days after inoculation on average, and up to a maximum of 12 days for some, supporting the isolation periods advocated in most guidelines.

Data from millions of ZOE COVID Symptom Study app contributors has shown that a hoarse voice can be a symptom of COVID-19.
Here’s how to spot it and what it feels like.
What is a hoarse voice like in COVID-19?
People using the app have reported changes to their voice which affected the sound of their speech.
A hoarse voice isn’t a very common symptom of COVID-19; however, during the beginning of the pandemic lots of clinical staff reported experiencing a hoarse voice during their illness.
A hoarse voice can sound, and feel, different from person to person.
For example, your voice might become more croaky, raspy, or rough, quieter or even change in pitch.
If you have a hoarse voice, you might feel like it requires more effort to speak.
We know that the COVID-19 virus affects the tissues in our respiratory system of which the voice box (larynx) is a part of.
This explains why some people get a hoarse voice during their infection.
While it’s not a particularly strong predictor of COVID-19, if you have an unexplained hoarse voice we believe you should get a test just to be sure.
When does a hoarse voice happen in COVID-19?
A hoarse voice can be an early symptom of COVID-19, but its pattern of presentation can vary.
Usually, it appears in the first week of illness and builds gradually.
For other people, a hoarse voice comes and goes.
On average, a hoarse voice will last two to three days but can last longer in adults (up to six or seven days compared to four days for children).
How common is a hoarse voice in COVID-19?
A hoarse voice isn’t a very common symptom of COVID-19 but the likelihood of having it increases with age.
13% of children, 29% of adults aged 16-35 and 32% of adults aged over 35 experience a hoarse voice during their illness.
Only 2% of people who were ill with COVID-19 reported a hoarse voice as their only symptom.
What other symptoms of COVID-19 are common alongside a hoarse voice?
A hoarse voice is most likely to occur alongside many other symptoms of COVID-19.
People reported a hoarse voice throat with varying combinations of symptoms, some of which are associated with a higher risk of needing hospital support.
In adults, a hoarse voice usually occurs with fatigue or headache.
In adults aged under 65, it also tends to happen alongside a sore throat and a loss of sense of smell.
A hoarse voice is reasonably common alongside other symptoms such as a persistent cough, fever, a loss of appetite and unusual muscle pains.
In children, a hoarse voice is most commonly associated with a sore throat, fatigue and headache and sometimes with fever, cough and loss of smell.
Depending on your age and sex, you should contact your doctor if you have multiple different symptoms of COVID-19 in the first week of being ill.
What should I do if I have a hoarse voice and think it might be COVID-19?
If you have an unexplained hoarse voice it could be COVID-19.
You should:
If you’re straining to speak you should try to rest your voice as much as possible.
Drinking plenty of liquids, particularly water, and taking simple painkillers like paracetamol or soluble aspirin can help alleviate discomfort.
Stay safe and keep logging.
Conditions include anxiety, depression and psychosis, according to the advisory.
The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services issued an advisory Wednesday warning about identifying mental health symptoms and conditions linked to long COVID.
Long COVID occurs when people recover from the virus but experience ongoing symptoms lasting three months or longer, such as coughing, headaches, fatigue, sleep disturbances and cognitive impairment.
According to the HHS, about 10% of all people who have previously contracted COVID-19 have experienced at least one symptom of long COVID.
Having to battle these physical symptoms for weeks or months on end "can take a toll on a person's mental health," HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement.
"It can be very challenging for a person, whether they are impacted themselves, or they are a caregiver for someone who is affected," Becerra continued.
"This advisory helps to raise awareness, especially among primary care practitioners and clinicians who are often the ones treating patients with long COVID.
"

The advisory found mental health symptoms and conditions linked to COVID include anxiety, depression, psychosis, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
Research has shown that social isolation -- due to lockdowns, school closures and stay-at-home orders -- increases the risks of anxiety, depression and loneliness, especially for older adults.
Additionally, unemployment and insecure employment increase the risk of depression and anxiety, studies have found, with more vulnerable groups such as Hispanic and Black people, women, young adults aged 18 to 29 years and those without a college degree.
The patient may not be the only person who suffers from poor mental health but also family members caring for them, the advisory stated.
Several factors may exacerbate mental health conditions including chronic physical and/or mental illness both physical and mental, social isolation, financial insecurity, caregiver burnout, and grief.
"We know that people living with long COVID need help today, and providers need help understanding what long COVID is and how to treat it," said Admiral Rachel Levine, assistant secretary for Health, said in a statement.
This advisory helps bridge that gap for the behavioral health impacts of long COVID.
This is one component of a government-wide response that continues to research long COVID and provide supports and services to those in need," she added.
Dr. Joshua Morganstein, chair of the American Psychiatric Association's committee on the psychiatric dimensions of disaster, told ABC News it's important to have long-term surveillance when it comes to mental health and long COVID to recognize the long-term trends.
Morganstein added, although not everyone may have access to the same resources, it's important to try and recognize mental health symptoms and to seek help if possible.
A cough or sneeze in the checkout line at the grocery store may elicit fear of COVID-19, but that maskless person quietly sitting next to you on the subway could pose just as much of a threat, public health experts say.
A significant proportion of COVID-19 transmission is asymptomatic or presymptomatic -- potentially as high as 60%, according to a 2021 JAMA Network Open modeling study.
That may be even higher now, as early reports have signaled a greater percentage of asymptomatic infections from Omicron than from previous variants.
That could have a lot to do with higher baseline levels of immunity in the population when that variant hit, Helen Chu, MD, MPH, an infectious diseases physician at the University of Washington School of Medicine, told MedPage Today.
Chu said the more exposure to COVID-19 that an individual has -- either in terms of prior infection or vaccination -- the broader the immunity and the better the ability to control the virus.
In such cases, an individual is more likely to be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, she said.
Those with diminished viral loads may be less likely to transmit the disease, but they can still infect others, she said.
And breakthrough cases can still carry high viral loads, as was observed in the Provincetown, Massachusetts outbreak in July 2021.
"Spaces that are not well ventilated, have large numbers of individuals, and places where people are speaking loudly or eating, those are the spaces that we should be most concerned about," Chu said.
Estimates of asymptomatic disease rates with COVID-19 -- the proportion who are infected but never manifest symptoms -- have ranged from about 25% to 40% throughout the pandemic, with a number of papers, including one in the Annals of Internal Medicine, coming in at about a third of cases.
There are no data yet on whether Omicron's subvariants, such as BA.2 and BA.4 and BA.5, cause more asymptomatic infections, Otto Yang, MD, an infectious diseases physician at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, told MedPage Today.
But he also noted that high levels of population immunity puts the U.S. in a "completely different situation from earlier when there weren't vaccines and few people had been infected.
"
Nonetheless, both Chu and Yang said the high rate of asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission highlights the need for continued mitigation measures, especially to protect vulnerable populations such as children under 5 and the immunocompromised.
"We know what works, and I just find it puzzling that we aren't continuing to do the things that work when we know that there's long COVID, the under-fives are unvaccinated, and people can get repeatedly infected over time," Chu said.
"We can't get to zero COVID, but it just surprises me that so many things have stopped, and in a time in which we have very little surveillance.
"
Yang also cautioned that continued transmission brings "more opportunity for new variants to develop, and the next variant could be more deadly for all we know.
"
Just last month, the CDC reported that as of February more than half of the U.S. population has been infected with COVID-19, including 75% of children and adolescents.
About a third became newly seropositive since December 2021, when Omicron became predominant in the U.S.
CDC noted that seroprevalence can improve understanding of population-level incidence of COVID-19 because some cases are asymptomatic, not diagnosed, or not reported.
However, it stated that seropositivity for antibodies produced in response to infection should not be interpreted as protection from future infection.
There also remains a concern about long COVID following infection, even one that occurs without acute symptoms, experts said.
"Given that community transmission levels are rising in most of the U.S., it is important we continue to layer mitigation measures to prevent further spread and exposure to the virus even if you are vaccinated," said Syra Madad, DHSc, MSc, of Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.
"While the risk at the individual level may be low if you are not in the high-risk category, and we have more tools to manage the disease including antivirals, the risk to the overall community is still high.

Stories about patients with persistent symptoms following infection with the coronavirus started surfacing in the news during the summer of 2020.
“When I heard people describe what they were feeling, they sounded very much like my patients with POTS,” says Tae Chung, a Johns Hopkins physiatrist with a joint appointment in the Johns Hopkins Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, and director of the Johns Hopkins Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) Program.
By December 2020, the program had received a flood of referrals for patients exhibiting symptoms similar to those of POTS, after Chung’s colleagues from comparable programs across the country were reporting that they, too, were receiving a large number of patient referrals dealing with POTS-like symptoms.
In October 2020, Chung launched a clinic specifically for patients who were once infected with SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes COVID-19 — and who now experience severe fatigue; orthostatic tachycardia, dizziness or intolerance to standing; chronic muscle pain; headache; and nausea, vomiting or irritable bowel syndrome.
Every flu season, Chung expects to meet new patients — as many as half of all patients with POTS previously had a viral or bacterial infection — but he’s never seen an influx of patients like the one he is seeing now.
“The virus clearly seems to be affecting the autonomic nervous system,” says Chung, “and we are seeing it manifest in two scenarios.”
These scenarios include patients who begin having POTS symptoms during the acute phase of COVID-19, and patients who don’t present with POTS symptoms until weeks after the acute phase.
The current proposed pathology for POTS is an inability to regulate blood volume.
Researchers suspect that vasomotor denervation causes dilation of the blood vessels, leading to reduced preload to the heart, which triggers an increase in the central sympathetic nervous system response.
Resulting symptoms are likely related to inadequate blood circulation and overcompensation by the sympathetic nervous system.
In collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Post-Acute COVID-19 Team (PACT) service, the Johns Hopkins Division of Infectious Disease and other domestic and international partners, Chung is coordinating research to understand the incidence of POTS after COVID-19 and whether the incidence is the same as after other infections.
He also aims to uncover if there is something about the condition that makes people more susceptible to developing POTS, including with regard to the disease’s effect on autoantibodies or on the sympathetic nervous system.
“The majority of patients in the Post-COVID-19 POTS clinic seem to have had very mild cases of COVID-19, and some were asymptomatic cases,” he says.
“If we can understand the relationship between COVID-19 and POTS, it will also help us understand the cause of POTS.”
Chung is concerned about the link between the disease and POTS, but he’s glad that patients are getting a diagnosis, so they can pursue treatment.
“Despite the good research around POTS and the evidence around autonomic nerve damage,” says Chung, “symptoms may be diagnosed as psychological.
A lot of people with chronic fatigue and heart palpitations end up in physiatry clinics because they are debilitated.
But there are various treatments for POTS that have been effective for many patients.”
To learn more, or to refer a patient, visit the Johns Hopkins Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) program website.
This study found that a noticeable amount of COVID-19-recovered patients still had (n = 24, 21%) persistent symptoms.
In 13% of the cases they persisted for 60 days and longer.
The three most frequent ones were Fatigue, Anosmia and Dyspnea.
These are also listed as long-term symptoms by the National Institute Health and Care Excellence18 and CDC as information for health care providers19.
While Fatigue and Dyspnea are explainable as general infection symptoms and manifestation of the lungs, Anosmia is reported to be a frequent symptom suspecting other pathogenesis than only nasal obstruction20.
There is growing evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 initiates key cellular processes in the olfactory epithelium21.
The results on persistent symptoms are similar to existing follow-up studies: A post-acute- follow-up study in Italy by Carfi et al.9 evaluated Fatigue and Dyspnea but not Anosmia as persistent symptoms (mean follow-up 60.3 days).
A follow-up study by Carvalho-Schneider et al.22 reported the identical set of our most common persistent symptoms (follow-up at day 30 and 60, non-critical COVID-19 patients).
Comparing to a study by Garrigues et al.23 with a mean of 110.9 days, Fatigue and Dyspnea were the most common, followed by Loss of Memory.
These findings support a common symptom set regardless of patient case severity.
However, as with many symptom-related infection studies, signs of neuro-degenerative or mental health disorders could be under-reported.
They were not documented in our study as they were not reported by the patients and not part of the structured forms.
Regarding duration of persistent symptoms, our results are significantly different: The post-acute setting in Carfi et al. observed 87.2% of patients having persistent symptom with mean follow-up of around 60 days.
Calvao-Schneider et al. 202022 reported that 66% of patients experienced symptoms at day 6022.
The difference should be explained by our comorbidity-free and relatively young population (median age: 41 ys).
Moreover, the majority of the population in Calvao-Schneider et al. had an initial hospitalization rate of 35% vs. 9% in our study.
The main strength of our study is the integration of detailed symptoms duration and raw lab-data, which enabled not only assessment of out of range values but also differences within the physiological range.
The study results show that some of the infection-related lab values remained out of range during follow-up.
In particular, lymphopenia—being frequently discussed as a result of direct or indirect viral interactions with lymphocytes12,13,14—remained in a considerable part of our study population, even beyond 90 days of follow-up (see Fig. 4).
Our subgroup analyses showed that patients with lymphopenia experienced more frequently persistent symptoms.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first COVID-19-related study on the duration of lymphopenia along with other routine lab values going beyond 30 days.
Further follow-up studies should assess lymphopenia with additional lab analysis to understand the pathogenetic details of lymphocyte-virus interaction.
There are many drivers being discussed to elucidate on the COVID-19-specific pathogenesis related to lymphopenia.
SARS-CoV-2 induced apoptosis in ACE2-receptor expressing lymphocytes was found as one possible mechanism that could lead to lymphopenia in COVID-1924.
The COVID-19 associated “cytokine storm” syndrome is considered another possible driver of lymphocyte apoptosis25,26.
Both mechanisms can possibly lead to rapid reduction of lymphocyte counts during acute infection.
In our study we found evidence that lymphopenia persists for weeks after recovery from acute disease.
There is rising evidence of bone marrow damage due to SARS-CoV-2 infection of hematopoietic stem cells27.
For SARS-CoV lymphopenia due to thymus suppression has been proposed28.
Both bone marrow damage and thymus suppression seem possible mechanisms that may lead to persisting lymphopenia after recovery from disease.
A recently published study provided evidence of increased mortality in COVID-19 patients during 6 month after recovery from disease.
Besides increased risk of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and thrombotic complications, rates of infections were found to be significantly increased29.
An association of persistent lymphopenia with increased rates of infections due to a relevant immunosuppressive status is hypothetic and needs further research.
The comparison of patients with vs without persistent symptoms did not show any differences of lab values except for one: serum concentration of total IgA antibodies.
In comparison, there were no significant changes regarding total IgG, IgM and all other lab-tests in Table 2.
Secretory IgA is an important factor of mucosal immunity for neutralization of toxins and pathogenic microbes30,31.
While a high level of serum IgA and SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA on diagnosis can initially correlate with disease severity32,33, our findings suggest that high levels during or after recovery is associated with a decrease in persistent symptoms.
In this regard, IgA may play a more important role than other immunoglobulin types.
As this study only reports on lab-value correlations, further research can complement our findings regarding causality.
The principal limitation of this study is the retrospective single-center design with symptom assessment not being objective and being prone to recall bias.
Moreover, the different follow-up times also lead to different time distances between last day of symptoms and the actual lab-assessment.
As some lab-values return to normal levels over a certain time, some lab tests and association with symptom persistence could have faded out and thus failed to show significance in our analysis.
Back in March, Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson were two of the first celebrities to test positive for COVID-19.
But as the Oscar-winning actor tells Stephen Colbert in the clip above, their symptoms were actually very different.
"Other than a headache, she had a higher fever than I did, she had horrible nausea," says Hanks, going on to say that while his wife also lost her sense of taste and smell, he kept his.
"I had bones that felt like they were made out of soda crackers," Hanks continues.
"Every time I moved around it felt like something was cracking inside of me.
"
His other symptom?
"A really sore butt."
(Muscle or body aches are on the CDC's list of symptoms.)
Hanks says it took them about eight or nine days to recover.
As you can imagine, he's not a big fan of people going out in public without their face masks on.
WATCH OUT From Covid toe to burping – 9 unusual virus symptoms and side effects to spot
CORONAVIRUS can present in many different ways and most people who catch Omicron will feel like they've got a cold.
But for some people, strange signs have appeared both during and after the infection period.
1 Catching coronavirus can leave you with cold-like symptoms, but some patients have experienced unusual signs
In most cases, symptoms clear up on their own as the body fights the infection, with vaccines offering a protective shield.
Earlier this month, the NHS added nine symptoms to its official list after scaling back free testing.
Since the start of the pandemic in 2020 just three featured on the official list - a high temperature, a loss of taste and smell and a new, persistent cough.
Despite the addition of nine symptoms, studies have suggested even more should be added.
Here, we take a look at some of the more unusual symptoms - and side effects - of Covid that don't feature on the NHS list.
1.
Covid toes
Doctors treating Covid-19 patients have reported seeing unusual cases where people have developed blisters and purple lesions on their feet.
It seems to be that anyone of any age can get Covid toes.
Although reports suggest children and teens suffer more with the condition.
It can present as red, inflamed toes sometimes with a rash and this can be sore and itchy, with blisters and swelling.
The affected toes, although some fingers have been reported too, can look red or purple.
Some patients can also get raised painful bumps or pus.
It can last for weeks or months, often with people suffering from it not experiencing the classic Covid symptoms.
2. Burping
Burping “normally happens up to 30 times a day”, both audibly and silently, according to experts.
It tends to happens after eating, particularly foods like broccoli, apples, pears and bread, or drinking something fizzy.
Some people may experience more burping while sick with Covid.
Model Olivia Molly Rogers, former Miss Universe contestant from Australia, said she “couldn’t stop burping” while infected in January.
In some people it can last for several weeks as part of long Covid, research has shown.
A study highlighted by researchers in the Lancet medical journal found 44 per cent of hospital patients from China had stomach-related problems three months after their discharge.
The 12 coronavirus symptoms listed by the NHS
The NHS has recently updated it's signs and symptoms list to include other ailments people commonly experience when they have Covid.
Here's the 12 signs: High temperature New persistent cough Loss of sense of smell or taste Shortness of breath Feeling tired or exhausted An aching body Headache Sore throat Blocked or runny nose Loss of appetite Diarrhoea Feeling sick or being sick
3.
Hearing loss
Experts previously reported a link between hearing loss and Covid-19, as many patients with long Covid had experienced hearing loss for months after contracting the virus.
Tinnitus is usually caused by an ear injury, age-related hearing loss or an underlying health condition.
Experts at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) along with the British Tinnitus and American Tinnitus Associations previously found that 40 per cent of people displaying symptoms of Covid were also experiencing a worsening of their tinnitus.
Experts at the University of Manchester also found that there is a strong association between Covid-19, hearing loss and a loss of balance.
4.
Smaller penis
Experts have said a shrinking penis is likely a result of erectile dysfunction that occurs due to virus infection.
A smaller penis was reported by 3.2 per cent of men in a study by scientists at King’s College London.
One anonymous man who has experienced erectile dysfunction and a reduced penis-size as a result of Covid called into the “How to Do It” podcast and said it had destroyed his self confidence.
Ashley Winter MD, a urologist in Portland, US, and associated with Kaiser Permanente, reassured men there are treatments that could help.
5. Sweating
Night sweats have been reported by some experts as a common feature of Omicron.
Speaking to ITV's Lorraine, Dr Amir Khan said patients were experiencing "those kind of drenching night sweats where you might have to get up and change your clothes".
It can leave your bed sheets and nightwear damp, or even soaking wet, even if the room you are sleeping in is cool.
This may be a cause of an embarrassment for those sharing a bed with a partner - although it’s likely only you will be aware of it.
6. Elevated heart rate
Experts at the British Heart Foundation said that your heart might beat faster is response to fever or inflammation due to Covid.
An increased heart rate is common if you have an infection as your heart has to work harder to pump more blood around your body to fight the infection.
The experts said that some people who have recovered from coronavirus have also experienced heart palpitations.
They said that in most scenarios the palpitations won't be serious but if they sit alongside a faster heart rate, chest pain and dizziness, then you should seek medication attention.
7.
Altered voice
Experts have also said that people who have coronavirus can suffer with a hoarse voice.
Dr Joseph Khabbaza said this is because inflammation is caused in the upper airway.
Speaking to Cleveland Health he said: "That includes the vocal cords.
Laryngitis can occur with any of those viruses.
“When an upper respiratory tract infection affects the lungs, like Covid-19, you’re going to be coughing even more.
“You already have an inflamed throat and vocal cords from the infection and then the secondary coughing that occurs can be quite violent and further irritating.
"
8.
Mood swings
If you’ve previously had Covid and are still feeling a bit “off”, you might be able to blame the virus.
A King’s College study found a number of symptoms flagged by long Covid sufferers that related to a change in mood.
A quarter of people said they had more anger since their infection, while 7.4 per cent reported aggression.
9.
Red or pink eyes
Irritated eyes can occur in some people with Covid infection.
The World Health Organization lists it as a less common symptom of the virus.
An early study, published in the BMJ Open Ophthalmology, found that of 83 Covid patients, 17 per cent had itchy eyes while 16 per cent had sore eyes.

It should clear up as you recover.
However, according to a King’s College study of long Covid, around 15 per cent of people reported “pink eye” (conjunctivitis), while the same figure had bloodshot eyes.
Amna Nawaz:
Three years after the start of the pandemic, some 16 million Americans have long COVID, meaning their symptoms continue well after the initial infection.
An estimated four million people say long COVID has significantly reduced their ability to carry out day-to-day activities.
For many of them, that includes their jobs.

Olympian Greg Rutherford shares his top tips on sleep
Over one million people in the UK have had long Covid, according to a report by the Office for National Stastistics (ONS) – released in the latter half of 2021.
Now, as the world gingerly enters March in the midst of multiple crises, new data suggests that COVID-19 may not just affect how you breath, but also how you sleep.
Express.co.uk recently spoke to Dr Greg Potter, a sleep expert about the potential impact of long Covid on sleep.
Dr Potter also explained the reason why people experienced such vivid dreams during the first lockdown.
On long Covid, Dr Potter had this to say: “While we don’t know that much about long Covid and sleep yet, it seems that people who have long Covid are more likely to develop different types of sleep issues.
"It seems that people are more likely to go onto develop what could be clinically identifiable sleep disorders not long after developing Covid."
Dr Potter’s notion isn’t his own, but based on an existing idea published in the British Medical Journal in January 2022.
This study concluded: “We found that the risks of incident mental health disorders are substantial in people with COVID-19 and span several categories, including… sleep disorders.
The risks were evident even among those with COVID-19 who did not require hospital admission.”

Poor sleep may be a symptom of Long Covid.
Notably the report finished with the recommendation: “Tackling mental health disorders among survivors of COVID-19 should be a priority.”
One of the authors of the report, Dr Ziyad-Aly, also authored a report published last month that warned those who experienced mild Covid had a much greater chance of developing heart disease.
In an interview with the Express, Dr Aly warned: “There need to be more resources put into the [health] system to establish more post-Covid clinics… where people can receive comprehensive or integrated care for long Covid.”
On what this meant for health services such as the NHS, Dr Aly told the Express: “Because of the enormity of it and the large number of people affected with Covid, and subsequently large number of people affected with cardiovascular disease, that’s going to pose a serious challenge on already strained health systems."

READ MORE Coronavirus: New ONS report shares effects of long Covid on children On what Long Covid could mean for people over the next few years, Dr Potter cautioned that it is: “Too early to tell what the long term implications of that are, but I think we’re going to realise what those are over time."
Those are the potential implications for long Covid and sleep, but what about an explanation?
During the first lockdown the public reported that they were having stranger dreams than they had before the pandemic.
According to Dr Potter, there’s a reason for this, and it has to do with the sleep cycle.

Dr Potter explains how the pandemic affected our dreams during the first national lockdown.
READ MORE Weight loss: Diet habits to ditch to end 'vicious cycle' Specifically, it has to do with the fact people were waking up later in their sleep cycle.
“Because a lot of people were able to sleep in longer in the morning because they weren’t commuting, they ended up spending more time in bed and what that meant was that more people were waking up from their dreams and therefore remembering their dreams.
“At the start of the night, we have more deep sleep and more so-called non-REM sleep “Later on we spend a lot of time in REM sleep and while we dream in all stages of our sleep, we have our most vivid and bizarre dreams in REM sleep and because more people were sleeping in longer, more people were waking up from REM sleep and were therefore remembering their dreams.”
How to sleep: a guide.
COVID-19 has few telltale signs, and fever is one of the prominent ones.
It is actually one of the initial symptoms a person experiences after getting infected with the contagious virus.
It is common in all variants of the coronavirus.
As per the revised guideline of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), no fever for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication after five days of its onset is also an indication to end the isolation.
But what if you never had a fever?
Can you still be infected with the contagious virus?
Updated at 6:29 p.m. ET on April 21, 2023
Charlie McCone has been struggling with the symptoms of long COVID since he was first infected, in March 2020.
Most of the time, he is stuck on his couch or in his bed, unable to stand for more than 10 minutes without fatigue, shortness of breath, and other symptoms flaring up.
But when I spoke with him on the phone, he seemed cogent and lively.
“I can appear completely fine for two hours a day,” he said.
No one sees him in the other 22.
He can leave the house to go to medical appointments, but normally struggles to walk around the block.
He can work at his computer for an hour a day.
“It’s hell, but I have no choice,” he said.
Like many long-haulers, McCone is duct-taping himself together to live a life—and few see the tape.
McCone knows 12 people in his pre-pandemic circles who now also have long COVID, most of whom confided in him only because “I’ve posted about this for three years, multiple times a week, on Instagram, and they’ve seen me as a resource,” he said.
Some are unwilling to go public, because they fear the stigma and disbelief that have dogged long COVID.
“People see very little benefit in talking about this condition publicly,” he told me.
“They’ll try to hide it for as long as possible.”
I’ve heard similar sentiments from many of the dozens of long-haulers I’ve talked with, and the hundreds more I’ve heard from, since first reporting on long COVID in June 2020.
Almost every aspect of long COVID serves to mask its reality from public view.
Its bewilderingly diverse symptoms are hard to see and measure.
At its worst, it can leave people bed- or housebound, disconnected from the world.
And although milder cases allow patients to appear normal on some days, they extract their price later, in private.
For these reasons, many people don’t realize just how sick millions of Americans are—and the invisibility created by long COVID’s symptoms is being quickly compounded by our attitude toward them.
Most Americans simply aren’t thinking about COVID with the same acuity they once did; the White House long ago zeroed in on hospitalizations and deaths as the measures to worry most about.
And what was once outright denial of long COVID’s existence has morphed into something subtler: a creeping conviction, seeded by academics and journalists and now common on social media, that long COVID is less common and severe than it has been portrayed—a tragedy for a small group of very sick people, but not a cause for societal concern.
This line of thinking points to the absence of disability claims, the inconsistency of biochemical signatures, and the relatively small proportion of severe cases as evidence that long COVID has been overblown.
“There’s a shift from ‘Is it real?’
to ‘It is real, but …,’” Lekshmi Santhosh, the medical director of a long-COVID clinic at UC San Francisco, told me.
Yet long COVID is a substantial and ongoing crisis—one that affects millions of people.
However inconvenient that fact might be to the current “mission accomplished” rhetoric, the accumulated evidence, alongside the experience of long haulers, makes it clear that the coronavirus is still exacting a heavy societal toll.
As it stands, 11 percent of adults who’ve had COVID are currently experiencing symptoms that have lasted for at least three months, according to data collected by the Census Bureau and the CDC through the national Household Pulse Survey.
That equates to more than 15 million long-haulers, or 6 percent of the U.S. adult population.
And yet, “I run into people daily who say, ‘I don’t know anyone with long COVID,’” says Priya Duggal, an epidemiologist and a co-lead of the Johns Hopkins COVID Long Study.
The implication is that the large survey numbers cannot be correct; given how many people have had COVID, we’d surely know if one in 10 of our contacts was persistently unwell.
But many factors make that unlikely.
Information about COVID’s acute symptoms was plastered across our public spaces, but there was never an equivalent emphasis that even mild infections can lead to lasting and mercurial symptoms; as such, some people who have long COVID don’t even know what they have.
This may be especially true for the low-income, rural, and minority groups that have borne the greatest risks of infection.
Lisa McCorkell, a long-hauler who is part of the Patient-Led Research Collaborative, recently attended a virtual meeting of Bay Area community leaders, and “when I described what it is, some people in the chat said, ‘I just realized I might have it.’
”
Admitting that you could have a life-altering and long-lasting condition, even to yourself, involves a seismic shift in identity, which some people are understandably loath to make.
“Everyone I know got Omicron and got over it, so I really didn’t want to concede that I didn’t survive this successfully,” Jennifer Senior, a friend and fellow staff writer at The Atlantic, who has written about her experience with long COVID, told me.
Duggal mentioned an acquaintance who, after a COVID reinfection, can no longer walk the quarter mile to pick her kids up from school, or cook them dinner.
But she has turned down Duggal’s offer of an appointment; instead, she is moving across the country for a fresh start.
“That is common: I won’t call it ‘long COVID’; I’ll just change everything in my life,” Duggal told me.
People who accept the condition privately may still be silent about it publicly.
“Disability is often a secret we keep,” Laura Mauldin, a sociologist who studies disability, told me.
One in four Americans has a disability; one in 10 has diabetes; two in five have at least two chronic diseases.
In a society where health issues are treated with intense privacy, these prevalence statistics, like the one-in-10 figure for long COVID, might also intuitively feel like overestimates.
Some long-haulers are scared to disclose their condition.
They might feel ashamed for still being sick, or wary about hearing from yet another loved one or medical professional that there’s nothing wrong with them.
Many long-haulers worry that they’ll be perceived as weak or needy, that their friends will stop seeing them, or that employers will treat them unfairly.
Such fears are well founded: A British survey of almost 1,000 long-haulers found that 63 percent experienced overt discrimination because of their illness at least “sometimes,” and 34 percent sometimes regretted telling people that they have long COVID.
“So many people in my life have reached out and said, ‘I’m experiencing this,’ but they’re not telling the rest of our friends,” McCorkell said.
Imagine that you interact with 50 people on a regular basis, all of whom got COVID.
If 10 percent are long-haulers, that’s five people who are persistently sick.
Some might not know what long COVID is or might be unwilling to confront it.
The others might have every reason to hide their story.
“Numbers like 10 percent are not going to naturally present themselves in front of you,” McCone told me.
Instead, “you’ll hear from 45 people that they are completely fine.”

The same factors that stop people from being public about their condition—ignorance, denial, or concerns about stigma—also make them less likely to file for disability benefits.
And that process is, to put it mildly, not easy.
Applicants need thorough medical documentation; many long-haulers struggle to find doctors who believe their symptoms are real.
Even with the right documents, applicants must hack their way through bureaucratic overgrowth, likely while fighting fatigue or brain fog.
For these reasons, attempting to measure long COVID through disability claims is a profoundly flawed exercise.
Even if people manage to apply, they face an average wait time of seven months and a two-in-three denial rate.
McCone took six weeks to put an application together, and, despite having a lawyer and extensive medical documentation, was denied after one day.
McCorkell knows many first-wavers—people who’ve had long COVID since March 2020—“who are just getting their approvals now.”
An alternative source of data comes from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey, which simply asks working-age Americans if they have any of six forms of disability.
Using that data, Richard Deitz, an economics-research adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, calculated that about 1.7 million more people now say they do than in mid-2020, reversing a years-long decline.
These numbers are lower than expected if one in 10 people who gets COVID really does become a long-hauler, but the survey doesn’t directly capture many of the condition’s most common symptoms, such as fatigue, neurological problems beyond brain fog, and post-exertional malaise, where a patient’s symptoms get dramatically worse after physical or mental exertion.
About 900,000 of the newly disabled people are also still working.
David Putrino, who leads a long-COVID rehabilitation clinic at Mount Sinai, told me that many of his patients are refused the accommodations required under the Americans With Disabilities Act.
Their employers won’t allow them to work remotely or reduce their hours, because, he said, “you look at them and don’t see an obvious disability.”
Long COVID can also seem bafflingly invisible when people look at it with the wrong tools.
For example, a 2022 study by National Institutes of Health researchers compared 104 long-haulers with 85 short-term COVID patients and 120 healthy people and found no differences in measures of heart or lung capacities, cognitive tests, or levels of common biomarkers—bloodstream chemicals that might indicate health problems.
This study has been repeatedly used as evidence that long COVID might be fictitious or psychosomatic, but in an accompanying editorial, Aluko Hope, the medical director of Oregon Health and Science University’s long-COVID program, noted that the study exactly mirrors what long-haulers commonly experience: They undergo extensive testing that turns up little and are told, “Everything is normal and nothing is wrong.”
The better explanation, Putrino told me, is that “cookie-cutter testing” doesn’t work—a problem that long COVID shares with other neglected complex illnesses, such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic-fatigue syndrome and dysautonomia.
For example, the NIH study didn’t consider post-exertional malaise, a cardinal symptom of both ME/CFS and long COVID; measuring it requires performing cardiopulmonary tests on two successive days.
Most long-haulers also show spiking heart rates when asked to simply stand against a wall for 10 minutes—a sign of problems with their autonomic nervous system.
“These things are there if you know where to look,” Putrino told me.
“You need to listen to your patients, hear where the virus is affecting them, and test accordingly.”
Contrary to popular belief, researchers have learned a huge amount about the biochemical basis of long COVID, and have identified several potential biomarkers for the disease.
But because long COVID is likely a cluster of overlapping conditions, there might never be a singular blood test that “will tell you if you have long COVID 100 percent of the time,” Putrino said.
The best way to grasp the scale of the condition, then, is still to ask people about their symptoms.
Large attempts to do this have been relatively consistent in their findings: The U.S. Household Pulse Survey estimates that one in 10 people who’ve had COVID currently have long COVID; a large Dutch study put that figure at one in eight.
The former study also estimated that 6 percent of American adults are long-haulers; a similar British survey by the Office for National Statistics estimated that 3 percent of the general population is.
These cases vary widely in severity, and about one in five long-haulers is barely affected by their symptoms—but the remaining majority very much is.
Another one in four long-haulers (or 4 million Americans) has symptoms that severely limit their daily activities.
The others might, at best, wake every day feeling as if they haven’t had any rest, or feel trapped in an endless hangover.
They might work or socialize when their tidal symptoms ebb, but only by making big compromises: “If I work a full day, I can’t also then make dinner or parent without significant suffering,” JD Davids, who has both long COVID and ME/CFS, told me.
Some people do recover.
A widely cited Israeli study of 1.9 million people used electronic medical records to show that most lingering COVID symptoms “are resolved within a year from diagnosis,” but such data fail to capture the many long-haulers who give up on the medical system precisely because they aren’t getting better or are done with being disbelieved.
Other studies that track groups of long-haulers over time have found less rosy results.
A French one found that 85 percent of people who had symptoms two months after their infection were still symptomatic after a year.
A Scottish team found that 42 percent of its patients had only partially recovered at 18 months, and 6 percent had not recovered at all.
The United Kingdom’s national survey shows that 69 percent of people with long COVID have been dealing with symptoms for at least a year, and 41 percent for at least two.
The most recent data from the U.S. and the U.K. show that the total number of long-haulers has decreased over the past six months, which certainly suggests that people recover in appreciable numbers.
But there’s a catch: In the U.K., the number of people who have been sick for more than a year, or who are severely limited by their illness, has gone up.
A persistent pool of people is still being pummeled by symptoms—and new long-haulers are still joining the pool.
This influx should be slower than ever, because Omicron variants seem to carry a lower risk of triggering long COVID, while vaccines and the drug Paxlovid can lower that risk even further.
But though the odds against getting long COVID are now better, more people are taking a gamble, because preventive precautions have been all but abandoned.
Even if prevalence estimates were a tenth as big, that would still mean more than 1 million Americans are dealing with a chronic illness that they didn’t have three years ago.
“When long COVID first came on the scene, everyone told us that once we have the prevalence numbers, we can do something about it,” McCorkell told me.
“We got those numbers.
Now people say, ‘Well, we don’t believe them.
Try again.’
”
To a degree, I sympathize with some of the skepticism regarding long COVID, because the condition challenges our typical sense of what counts as solid evidence.
Blood tests, electronic medical records, and disability claims all feel like rigorous lines of objective data.
Their limitations become obvious only when you consider what the average long-hauler goes through—and those details are often cast aside because they are “anecdotal” and, by implication, unreliable.
This attitude is backwards: The patients’ stories are the ground truth against which all other data must be understood.
Gaps between the data and the stories don’t immediately invalidate the latter; they just as likely show the holes in the former.
Laura Mauldin, the disability sociologist, argues that the U.S. is primed to discount those experiences because the country’s values—exceptionalism, strength, self-reliance—have created what she calls the myth of the able-bodied public.
“We cannot accept that our bodies are fallible, or that disability is utterly ordinary and expected,” she told me.
“We go to great pains to pretend as though that is not the case.”
If we believe that a disabling illness like long COVID is rare or mild, “we protect ourselves from having to look at it.”
And looking away is that much easier because chronic illnesses like long COVID are more likely to affect women—“who are more likely to have their symptoms attributed to psychological problems,” Mauldin said—and because the American emphasis on work ethic devalues people who can’t work as much or as hard as their peers.
Other aspects of long COVID make it hard to grasp.
Like other similar, neglected chronic illnesses, it defies a simplistic model of infectious disease in which a pathogen causes a predictable set of easily defined symptoms that alleviate when the bug is destroyed.
It challenges our belief in our institutions, because truly contending with what long-haulers go through means acknowledging how poorly the health-care system treats chronically ill patients, how inaccessible social support is to them, and how many callous indignities they suffer at the hands of even those closest to them.
Long COVID is a mirror on our society, and the image it reflects is deeply unflattering.
Most of all, long COVID is a huge impediment to the normalization of COVID.
It’s an insistent indicator that the pandemic is not actually over; that policies allowing the coronavirus to spread freely still carry a cost; that improvements such as better indoor ventilation are still wanting; that the public emergency may have been lifted but an emergency still exists; and that millions cannot return to pre-pandemic life.
“Everyone wants to say goodbye to COVID,” Duggal told me, “and if long COVID keeps existing and people keep talking about it, COVID doesn’t go away.”
The people who still live with COVID are being ignored so that everyone else can live with ignoring it.
Laura Bramante knew something was wrong when she couldn't smell or taste her morning coffee.
That was a week ago.
The 29-year-old says it was an intense loss of smell and taste like she had never experienced before.
"It is very altered, it still is very strange."
Laura Bramante is a 29-year-old account manager from Fitzroy North.

but as it was her only symptom, she was knocked back because she didn't fit the criteria.
"It was the only symptom that I had and they said to me that they'd actually never heard of the taste or smell symptom before and (said) that they won't go ahead with getting me tested.
"
It was only after exaggerating other symptoms that she was eventually tested.

The results came back positive and she's been in quarantine since.
Melbourne ear, nose and throat surgeon Dr Stephen Kleid says it's not an unusual symptom for the virus.
"It's because the lining of the nose and sinuses is the same as the lining of the lung and that's the target organ that the virus initially attaches to.
"
Globally, it's more common than we think, a survey of 2,000 patients with a mild infection in South Korea found 15 percent had some degree of smell loss.

In the UK, ear nose and throat surgeons wrote a letter saying "these patients may be some of the hitherto hidden carriers that have facilitated the rapid spread of COVID-19.
"
As more Australian patients experience the condition, there are calls for the loss of sense of smell to be recognised as an official symptom here, to identify those unwittingly carrying and potentially spreading the virus.
"I would suggest that patients who've lost their sense of smell should be tested and isolated again they should be treated as if they might be carrying the virus.

Most experts agree the testing criteria will be broadened depending on the number of kits and resources.
For a small group of nonhospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), self-administration of high-dose oral famotidine was found to be associated with improvements in disease-related symptoms, according to a recently published case series.
Famotidine, an over-the-counter histamine H 2 receptor antagonist, was recently identified as a potential therapy for COVID-19 based on findings from a retrospective cohort study that included hospitalized patients.
In this case series, longitudinal changes in patient reported outcome measures were quantitatively assessed in 10 COVID-19 patients who self-administered famotidine as outpatients.
Questionnaires and telephone interviews were used to obtain information on patient demographics, COVID-19 diagnosis, use of famotidine, drug-related adverse events, temperature measurements, oxygen saturation values, and symptoms scores.
“Based on a National Institute of Health (NIH)-endorsed Protocol to research Patient Experience of COVID-19, we collected longitudinal severity scores of 5 symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, headaches and anosmia) and general unwellness on a 4-point ordinal scale modelled on performance status scoring,” the authors explained.
Statistical comparisons were made between longitudinal combined normalized symptom scores.
The analysis included 10 consecutive COVID-19 patients with diverse demographics and various risk factors associated with disease severity.
The most common dose of famotidine self-administered was 80mg three times daily (n=6) for a median of 11 days (range: 5-21 days).

Findings of the analysis revealed that treatment with famotidine was both well tolerated and beneficial, with rapid improvements noted within 24 to 48 hours after starting the drug.
“In addition, for all patients who were able to provide data, temperature readings, oxygen saturations and activity improved in correlation with taking famotidine,” the authors stated.
Moreover, symptoms continued to improve to close to pre-illness levels 14 days after the first dose was administered.
The study patients reported that airwary-related symptoms (ie, cough, shortness of breath) improved faster than systemic symptoms (ie, fatigue) while taking famotidine.
“Our case series suggests, but does not establish, a benefit from famotidine treatment in outpatients with COVID-19,” the authors concluded.
They added, “Future work will investigate potential mechanisms of action and clinical relevance of famotidine.”

Fever, cough and shortness of breath are a few of the COVID-19 symptoms listed on the CDC's website.
After a routine visit with her doctor on March 25, Shawna Riley, 48, learned other symptoms could be related to the coronavirus.
"It's what we call Mottling, and I had never heard of that before, so of course I tried to do some research," said Riley.
Riley first noticed the rash two weeks prior to her doctor's visit.
The nurse practitioner recommended she see a dermatologist.
The doctor wanted her to do a biopsy.
Riley, a 10-year cancer survivor, thought of the other scary C-word, not coronavirus.
Both her dermatologist and primary care doctor assessed her medical records and advised her to quarantine.
"They both felt as though I actually probably had been exposed to COVID-19," said Riley.
Tuesday, the Cleveland Clinic posted an article of an early report from dermatologists working with COVID-19 patients in Italy.
According to the small study, of 88 confirmed positive patients, 20% developed skin symptoms.
A little under half developing a rash at the onset of disease.
Dr. Jon Mendelsohn of Advanced Cosmetic Surgery and Laser Center in Cincinnati manages skin.
"I would seek professional guidance, and medical care, and really look at the symptoms and signs," said Mendelsohn.
He said people who may be experiencing a rash shouldn't jump to conclusions or fear the worst.
"Not every rash is going to be COVID, I can tell you that for sure, and I can tell you that probably a very small percentage of COVID patients will probably have rashes from what I've seen," said Mendelsohn.
It's important to note, Riley who has COPD and has been hospitalized for pneumonia in the past, falls into the high risk category for COVID-19.
Her doctors took that into consideration when deciding to have her quarantine for 14 days.
Riley has not experienced any other symptoms related to the coronavirus.
Chicago Bulls star DeMar DeRozan was relieved to return to practice Saturday for the first time in 10 days after becoming the third player caught in the team’s COVID-19 outbreak.
The NBA postponed two Bulls games this week and placed the team under tight restrictions after 10 players entered league’s health and safety protocols.
They haven’t played a game since Dec. 11.
DeRozan is cleared to return Sunday night against the Los Angeles Lakers at the United Center, as are Coby White and Javonte Green.
Derrick Jones Jr. also has exited protocols and is listed as questionable.
The Bulls are far from returned to normal — Matt Thomas remains in protocols despite being listed as doubtful for Sunday’s game, and Zach LaVine, Ayo Dosunmu, Troy Brown Jr. and Alize Johnson are expected to remain sidelined through Christmas, according to coach Billy Donovan.
But with no new cases among players or coaches, the Bulls are hopeful they’ve escaped the widest team outbreak in the NBA so far this season.
Without any symptoms, DeRozan said the greatest challenge was staying grounded amid the frustration and confusion of the outbreak.
Bulls forward DeMar DeRozan (11) drives to the basket against Heat guard Kyle Lowry in the second half on Nov. 27 at the United Center.
“That was the crazy thing, sitting there fine and trying to figure out why I’m sitting here doing nothing,” DeRozan said.
“I felt completely fine.
The only symptom I had was boredom, honestly.”
DeRozan structured his days around COVID-19 testing and basketball.
He reported to test outside the Bulls training facility every morning, then returned home to nap before watching every NBA game scheduled for the day.
DeRozan trained lightly in the evenings, alternating between stretches and simple exercises such as jumping rope or doing pushups.
When he ran out of basketball to watch, DeRozan switched to football.
Even with plenty of sports to consume, DeRozan said those days were marked by boredom as he itched to return to the court and help his teammates.
“It’s just mentally exhausting just seeing everything that’s going on around the league, just being affected by it,” DeRozan said.
“It can be frustrating, it can be confusing, it can be a lot of things at once.
It’s just something we’ve got to continue to deal with, try (to) maneuver around it and make the most of it when we can.”
The Bulls outbreak began with White on Dec. 1 and quickly enveloped 10 players on the roster: Green (Dec. 3), DeRozan (Dec. 5), Thomas (Dec. 7), Jones Jr. (Dec. 9), Dosunmu and Johnson (Saturday), LaVine and Brown (Sunday) and Johnson (Monday).
Broadcasters Stacey King and Bill Wennington also entered protocols amid the outbreak, and center Nikola Vucevic previously spent 11 days in isolation after testing positive Nov. 11.
Many Bulls players in protocols were asymptomatic like DeRozan, but others experienced mild symptoms.
White said he returned a low-grade fever of around 99 degrees and suffered from headaches and congestion for three to four days.
Although this sickness was noticeable, White likened it to a cold and said recovery hasn’t been a challenge.
With half of the Bulls in isolation, White said his teammates stayed connected through a group chat, teasing each other and cracking jokes about getting tested.
“We got a lighthearted group, a spiritual group,” White said.
“We got good personalities and spirits on the team.
Nobody was like, ‘Man, this is BS.’
We were all just making jokes.
We don’t have those type of personalities where dudes were upset or angry.
Our group is funny, goofy.
We just got the ‘it is what it is’ mentality and keep pushing.”
The Bulls outbreak was the most extensive in the league but quickly was matched.
The Brooklyn Nets equaled the Bulls’ high when Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving entered protocols Saturday, bringing the team’s total to 10.
More than 70 NBA players entered the league’s protocols this month, and at least 50 of those cases occurred in the last seven days.
Before December, only 16 players had entered the protocols.
“When it started happening with us, I was confident in knowing that it wasn’t just going to be us,” DeRozan said.
These outbreaks have created a challenge for the NBA, which is facing a potential need to shut down games as the omicron and delta variants pummel cities across the U.S.
The nationwide spike comes amid the highly anticipated span of scheduling between the Christmas and New Year’s holiday games, which are major broadcast revenue drivers for the league.
When asked to offer his take on the league’s quandary, White held up both hands and pled the fifth.
“I don’t want to get into that,” White said.
“I don’t really know.
I want to hoop and everybody else wants to hoop.
Whatever they come up with, that’s what I’m going to follow.”
Dylan O'Brien has tested positive for COVID-19.
The Maze Runner actor, 30, revealed his diagnosis on Twitter Monday, writing that he was "all good" and "experiencing mild symptoms.
"
"Being vaxxed & boosted (and having it with Obama) is v much helping," said O'Brien, referring to former President Barack Obama's recent COVID-19 diagnosis.
The star went on to share that he "had to cancel [the] rest of press" — seemingly for his new film The Outfit — as a result of his illness.
"Sobering reminder that we're still in a pandemic," O'Brien added, signing off with, "Stay safe be mindful x.

This spring, our daughter insisted that my husband and I, both in our 60s, get the latest weapon in the fight against the novel coronavirus: the pulse oximeter, a device that can measure the level of oxygen in the blood.
Recent reports have shown that a lower-than-healthy level of oxygen saturation in the blood can be an early predictor of covid-related pneumonia, even in those with mild symptoms.
Even after six months, there are no successful definitive therapies for COVID-19, nor an effective vaccine, other the recently approved, ‘Emergency Use Authorization’ of the antiviral remdesivir in COVID-19 disease.
The greatest threat of mortality remains among the elderly and those with coexisting illnesses.
Now, a new study published on the preprint server medRxiv* in July 2020 discusses the explanation in terms of the biological aging markers in patients with severe disease, rather than the chronological age.

Age and Disease Boosts COVID-19 Mortality
The mortality rate in COVID-19 is projected to be between 10% and 27% in people aged 85 years and over, compared to 3-11% for the age group 65-84 years, 1-3% for those aged 55-64 years, and <1% for those 20-54 years of age.
Overall, the mortality risk is a hundred times higher for people aged 85-plus relative to the under-50s.
And people above 65 years account for 80% of deaths in the USA at present.
Another high-risk factor for mortality is the presence of diseases like cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
The Study: Predictive Ability of Phenotypic Age
To pull these together, the current authors used their previously validated biomarkers of aging, which have been found to predict both sickness and death risk in the short and long term for non-COVID-19 individuals.
These markers have led them to consider the theory that biological aging rather than chronological aging is a more powerful influence on the severity profile of COVID-19.
This new study by an international team of researchers aimed to measure the risk and the predictive ability of advanced aging biomarkers, using a risk profile called Phenotypic Age or PhenoAge, for short.
This is a supervised machine learning model that was trained using 42 biomarker inputs to predict all-cause mortality.
The researchers used this measure on biomarker data from 2006 to 2010, from over 440,000 participants, to arrive at the PhenoAge.
This was then combined with information on diseases developed over the long-term, up to 2017.
The researchers then examined the presence of an association between PhenoAge and COVID-19 severity.
Of the participants, about 25,000 died before the pandemic, using a cut-off of February 1, 2020.
Of the usable data, more than 55% came from females, and 94% said they were White, 2% as Black, and 4% all others.
Of these, 6,100 were tested from March 16 to March 31, 2020.
About 21% were positive and recovered.
3% were positive and died after being infected, between March 5 and April 26, 2020.
The mean chronological age was 68 years on April 26, 2020, with 64% being at least 65 years.
The baseline PhenoAge was available for over 347,000 samples.
The researchers found that the mean chronological age, at 56 years, was 2.5 years more than the mean PhenoAge at 54 years.
Does Accelerated Aging Increase Risk of COVID-19 Death?
The PhenoAge was used to estimate accelerated phenotypic age (PhenoAgeAccel) at baseline, which represents the difference between an individual’s phenotypic age compared to that expected at the current age.
The researchers also looked at two outcomes: whether the COVID-19 tests were positive, and whether the patient with a positive test died.
The researchers used the two outcomes above in four different models, namely:
Current chronological age
Current age plus baseline PhenoAgeAccel
Current age plus pre-existing disease conditions
Current age plus pre-existing disease states plus baseline PhenoAgeAccel
They then considered the possibility that a higher PhenoAgeAccel, meaning more rapid biological aging, would positively associate with severe COVID-19.
They found that men and Black patients were more likely to have a positive test and to die of confirmed disease, and to test positive, respectively.
In the first model, age at COVID-19 was not associated significantly with positive tests when adjusted for demographic factors.
Model 2, when adjusted for demographic and accelerated phenotypic age evaluated 10-14 years before the current date also showed minimal correlation.
Current age was associated with lower risk when adjusted for pre-existing disease states – the third model.
The fourth model was also protective.
Accelerating Aging Linked to Severe COVID-19
The researchers found that in the second model, the odds that the individual would test positive for COVID-19 went up by 1.3 with each 5-year increase in PhenoAgeAccel, and the odds of death from any cause went up by 1.55.
The third and fourth models included diseases that were individually linked to higher test positivity and deaths from all causes, even when adjusted for current age and demographics.
These models showed that accelerated phenotypic age was linked to more severe COVID-19 symptoms as measured by either outcome.
This continued to be significant even when various chronic disease conditions were adjusted for.
Secondly, once they adjusted for older biological age, COVID-19 severity was less heavily linked with some disease conditions like a history of pneumonia, diabetes, and chronic lung disease.
The researchers suggest that this association could be due to the underlying pathways of immune activation in both disease conditions.
Underlying Chronic Inflammation Holds the Key?
Prior research by the same team showed that PhenoAgeAccel was associated with biological processes linked to immune activation, cell cycle functions, and carbohydrate digestion and metabolism.
These previous studies also trained a biological clock based on DNA methylation, called DNAmPhenoAge, where PhenoAge represented the biological age rather than the chronological age.
They found that this clock was related to the activation of various chemicals that marked the presence of inflammation, repair of DNA damage, active transcription and translation, and immune senescence.
These indicate inflammaging, or an acceleration of chronic inflammation, which underlies both accelerated biological aging and severe COVID-19 infection.
Such inflammaging processes include loss of genomic stability, senility of individual cells, impaired function of mitochondria, changes in the microbial populations of the body, inflammasome activation, and an abnormal.loss of regulation of immune cell responses without any apparent underlying factor, as well as chronic infections.
This is important because these could present targets to prevent severe COVID-19.
Current Age Less Important than PhenoAge
Why was there no obvious impact of current chronological age on these outcomes?
The researchers suggest this could be because of the time lag between the baseline blood draw and the current pandemic.
Instead of this parameter, when the length of follow-up is used to predict risk, there is a positive correlation with increasing age and COVID-19 severity.
The researchers feel that simultaneous assessment of PhenoAgeAccel for all participants would have shown that chronological age has a much less significant or even insignificant effect on these outcomes.
In support of this, they point to the reversal of the association of chronological age with test positivity when they adjusted for the presence of other diseases.
It could be that among people with comparable illnesses at the time of the earlier assessment, younger people were aging faster, and this accounts for the higher mortality.
On the other hand, the adjusted age-related risk remains higher, which shows that disease alone is not the sole cause of the increased risk of death.
Implications of the Study
The researchers stress that the most important finding from the study is that the PhenoAge measure had reliable predictive power, even though it was computed ten years or more before the current pandemic appeared, and though it was not connected to either the chronological age or the presence of other disease states.
This could be because the biomarkers are based on their predictive power for age-linked mortality when used in combination.
They say, “The biomarker-specific associations in this study may shed light on the key aging signals that may be driving the association between biological aging and COVID-19 severity.”
The most robust links were between albumin levels and a positive COVID-19 test, and between death due to any cause in an individual with confirmed COVID-19 with high glucose levels.
Glucose may promote viral replication and antiviral immunosuppression.
High glucose levels are already known to increase the risk of death in flu patients.
Low albumin was also linked to severe COVID-19, as found in many prior studies.
This correlation with albumin levels measured more than ten years earlier confirms that the low levels of albumin are due to chronic inflammation, as also shown by a high C-reactive protein (CRP) and leukocyte count, rather than because of reduced albumin production.
Despite the current relevance of an aging study that occurred long ago, it could also be that some individuals who had accelerated aging later improved their health, but others showed reverse movement.
This would mean that a more recent PhenoAge could improve the predictive value of this measure.
Secondly, the study points to two different target pathways for treating COVID-19.
One is the underlying inflammatory mechanisms that link accelerated aging and severe COVID-19.
The other is the aging process.
In the latter, drugs like metformin and rapamycin, that slow aging, could be used to treat this condition.
Rapamycin boosts the efficacy of the flu vaccine, and metformin lowers blood glucose levels.
Moreover, it is being suggested that the latter could suppress the inflammatory activation of immune cells.

COVID-19, the disease that has caused the coronavirus pandemic, is a respiratory illness that has symptoms that can include fatigue, a persistent cough and fevers.
However, researchers in Spain believe they have discovered another symptom —lesions on feet.
According to a statement from the Spanish General Council of Official Podiatrist Colleges, the lesions are described as similar to those seen with chickenpox and can largely be seen on the feet of children and adolescents.
They have also been spotted on some adults.
RELATED: CoronavirusNOW.com, FOX launches national hub for COVID-19 news and updates
"It is a curious finding that began yesterday to spread in the healthcare field, among dermatologists and podiatrists, fundamentally: the same symptoms are increasingly being detected in patients with COVID -19, especially children and adolescents, although some cases have also been detected in adults," the statement reads.
"These are purple-colored lesions (very similar to those of chickenpox, measles or chilblains) that usually appear around the toes and that usually heal without leaving marks on the skin.
"
The lesions have been found in Italy, France and Spain, the researchers added.
Spain is the second-most affected country in the world, with nearly 185,000 cases.
Italy and France have the third and fourth-most confirmed cases at 168,941 and 147,101 cases, respectively.
The statement added a link to a research paper from the International Federation of Podiatrists, specifically citing a case of a 13-year-old boy with lesions and no other symptoms of the virus.
As such, it's possible the lesions could be a warning sign of the virus, with the council urging its members to be "very vigilant" in detecting what could be "a sign of COVID-19 detection that can help to avoid the spread.
"
As of Friday morning, more than 2.1 million coronavirus cases have been diagnosed worldwide, more than 671,000 of which are in the U.S., the most impacted country on the planet.
Rash-like mouth lesions may be a new symptom of COVID-19, Spanish researchers suggest.
Health experts examined the mouths of 21 patients with COVID-19 at Ramon y Cajal University Hospital in Madrid who had rashes on their skin to determine if they had enanthem - a rash inside the body on the mucous membrane.
The study's findings - published in JAMA Dermatology - found six of the patients with skin rash had some form of enanthem in their mouths.
Mouth lesions were found in COVID-19 patients in a small study by Spanish researchers.

The patients were aged between 40 and 69.
Four of the six were female.
"This work describes preliminary observations and is limited by the small number of cases and the absence of a control group," researchers wrote in the study.
"Despite the increasing reports of skin rashes in patients with COVID-19, establishing an etiological diagnosis is challenging.
However, the presence of enanthem is a strong clue that suggests a viral etiology rather than a drug reaction, especially when a petechial pattern is observed," the study said.
Due to safety concerns around coronavirus infections, many patients suspected or known to have COVID-19 do not have their mouths examined, researchers noted.
The study said enanthems were previously found in some Italian COVID-19 patients.
The mouth lesions join a growing list of strange coronavirus symptoms detected by health experts.

What started out as a virus defined by a cough and a fever has diversified almost exponentially since it arrived on the scene in late 2019.
Now, people with Covid-19 can report a range of side effects, from a loss of taste or small to developing conjunctivitis, and while it is widely believed that Omicron, the latest variant of the virus, triggers much milder symptoms in many sufferers, it can also have a rather ‘scary’ impact on your sleep.
Currently, almost 200,000 people across the UK are testing positive for Omicron every day, and many have been reporting a new symptom that can disrupt your sleep.
Night sweats have already been listed as a common symptom of the variant, but now reports of those experiencing sleep paralysis while suffering from coronavirus are increasing, reports Glasgow Live.
The NHS website describes sleep paralysis as "when you cannot move or speak as you are waking up or falling asleep".
The sensation can be 'terrifying' for anyone who experiences it, however the NHS adds that it is harmless and that most people will only get it once or twice in their life.
The sensation has described as feeling as though someone is in your room or as if something is pushing you down can last up to several minutes.
Many sufferers have turned to social media to ask whether other Covid-19 sufferers are experiencing paralysis, or to discuss their experience with it:

Long Covid has more than 200 symptoms that affect ten organs, the largest international study of “long haulers” suggests.
British health experts are calling for a nationwide screening programme to help identify the condition in people who may be suffering in silence.
The study, led by University College London (UCL), has identified 203 symptoms of long Covid affecting the organs, with 66 lasting up to seven months.
The most common reported by almost four thousand sufferers were fatigue, brain post-exertional malaise — where symptoms worsen after physical or mental exertion — and cognitive dysfunction, often called “brain fog”.
Other shared symptoms included hallucinations, tremors, itchy skin, changes to the menstrual cycle, sexual dysfunction, heart palpitations, bladder control issues, shingles, memory loss, blurred vision, diarrhoea and
One of the scary things about COVID-19 is that the early symptoms it presents are also common indicators of a flu or infection: fever, cough, and so on.
When a person experiences any of these symptoms these days, it’s reasonable to wonder if they have COVID-19.
Now researchers from the Kuhn Lab as University of Southern California have discovered something that may be useful for anyone questioning whether they’ve been infected with COVID-19.
According to their investigation, it’s likely that coronavirus symptoms present in a particular order.
This is unusual — other illness that produces these symptoms don’t follow any known sequence — and if a person gets these symptoms in this particular order, they should self-isolate and get tested.
The study is published in Frontiers in Public Health.

The USC team says that coronavirus’ symptoms present in this order:
fever cough and muscle pain nausea and/or vomiting diarrhea
What really sets apart COVID-19 from other diseases is the timing of the nausea/vomiting and diarrhea.
While the respiratory symptoms are similar to those associated with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the gastrointestinal sequence of COVID-19 is distinctive.
COVID-19 attacks the upper GI tract first, causing nausea/vomiting before moving down to the lower GI tract, producing diarrhea.
This is the opposite of the way in which these symptoms appear with MERS and SARS.
“This order is especially important to know when we have overlapping cycles of illnesses like the flu that coincide with infections of COVID-19, says study co-author Peter Kuhn.
“Doctors can determine what steps to take to care for the patient, and they may prevent the patient’s condition from worsening.”
The study calls for further investigation into the presenting symptoms of COVID-19, since unanswered questions remain.
Might the order of symptoms vary with outlier strains of SARS-CoV-2?
Do other risk factors such as obesity, or environmental factors such as temperature affect their order?
The core data set used by the USC team were case histories of 55,000 people who contracted COVID-19 in China.
The data was collected by the World Health Organization from February 16-24, 2020.
Their analysis was supplemented by data from almost 1,100 additional cases documented by the China Medical Treatment Expert Group via the National Health Commission of China — these came from December 11, 2019 to January 29, 2020.
To assess the similarity of COVID-19’s symptom ordering to the flu, the researchers looked at the data from 2,470 North American, European, and Southern Hemisphere flu cases from 1994 to 1998.
“The importance of knowing first symptoms is rooted in the need to stop the spread of COVID-19, a disease that is two to three times more transmissible than influenza and results in outbreaks of clusters.’
— Larsen, et al
Lead study author Joseph Larsen says that in addition to slowing transmission, an understanding of COVID-19’s progression could also facilitate more effective treatment.
“The order of the symptoms matter.
Knowing that each illness progresses differently means that doctors can identify sooner whether someone likely has COVID-19, or another illness, which can help them make better treatment decisions,” says Larsen, who adds, “Given that there are now better approaches to treatments for COVID-19, identifying patients earlier could reduce hospitalization time.”
The highly contagious subvariant of Omicron, known as BA.2, has prompted concern among health officials as it becomes the dominant version of the coronavirus around the world.
So far, signs suggest that BA.2 is 30 to 80 percent more transmissible than the original version of Omicron, and cases are already going up in several states across the United States.
While we have tools to prepare for a spike in cases — vaccination, frequent testing, high-quality masks and social distancing — experts worry that the public’s capacity to keep up with precautionary measures is waning.
To make matters even trickier, you won’t know for sure if you’re dealing with BA.2 or the original Omicron subvariant.
“It’s not something that’s reported clinically,” said Dr. Stuart Ray, an infectious diseases specialist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore.
A new study out of Wuhan, China, where the novel coronavirus was first detected last year, indicates that some children infected with COVID-19 may show eye symptoms.
In recent weeks, pediatric coronavirus cases have increased across the country.
While most children do not experience serious health consequences, the coronavirus is also linked to multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a rare but serious condition that tends to appear several weeks after a child recovers from COVID-19.
The recent study, which was published in the medical journal JAMA Ophthalmology on August 26, examined 216 children between the ages of 2 and 11 years old.
All children had tested positive for COVID-19, and while many symptomatic patients had common coronavirus symptoms like fevers and coughs, 49 (22.7%) of the children studied showed "various ocular manifestations."
Similar symptoms have also been seen in adults.
The study found that the most common eye symptom was conjunctival discharge, which was seen in more than half of the children with eye symptoms.
Children who had other symptoms, like a cough, were more likely to show ocular symptoms, such as conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye.
Dr. Neil Bressler, an ophthalmologist based in Baltimore, Maryland and the editor of JAMA Ophthalmology, said that he believed the study to be "clinically relevant" and could help with diagnosing the virus in children.
"(The study) tells us as ophthalmologists that, if you're seeing children and they have pink eye or other signs of conjunctivitis ...
that could be a sign of COVID-19," he said.
However, Bressler noted that a case of pink eye wasn't necessarily a guarantee that a child had the novel coronavirus, since just over 22% of the children in the study showed similar symptoms.
"It's not to the level of 'We need to change the policy and check all children (for pink eye),' but it's important that people realize that this is important," Bressler said.
"It doesn't necessarily mean that every child that walks in with conjunctivitis should be getting tested for COVID-19.
"
He said that on their own, eye symptoms were likely not a sign of the virus, but if a parent knew their child had been exposed to the virus, or if they had shown other symptoms, such as a fever or cough, it could be good to get them tested.
Dr. Sonal Tuli, an ophthalmologist based in Gainesville, Florida and a clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, cautioned that even though the eye symptoms may not be coronavirus-related, parents should still keep children who are displaying signs of conjunctivitis home from school or other activities.
"Pink eye that looks like COVID just looks like pink eye, there’s no way to distinguish it from pink eye that comes from anything else," Tuli said.
"Pink eye by itself is very infectious too, so those children should be kept home.
Kids will touch their eyes, touch the toys, put it in their mouths, and other children could touch those toys, then touch their eyes ...
That’s how pink eye spreads through daycare centers and schools.
"
Tuli agreed with Bressler that since children get pink eye very frequently, that alone may not mean you should get a child tested for COVID-19.
"A lot of upper respiratory tract infections, including the cold and flu, can cause pink eye.
The eyes and nose are infected, and things that inflame one can irritate the other," she said.
Bressler said that unfortunately, there is no way to distinguish coronavirus-related pink eye from normal pink eye.
In some cases, coronavirus can be contracted through the eyes, which can be prevented by avoiding touching the face.
Some experts have recommended wearing goggles or other protective eyewear, but both Tuli and Bressler said that that was likely unnecessary in day-to-day life.
"If someone sneezed right into your eyes, the goggles would protect you, but usually if someone's going to sneeze or cough, we move away.
I don't think that right now, at least for people walking around, you don't have to wear goggles," Bressler said.
Extreme heat can exacerbate long Covid symptoms
Last week’s scorching temperatures created a range of challenges for people in the Seattle area, including for those experiencing long-term symptoms after a Covid-19 infection, known as long Covid.
“There absolutely is an impact of heat on our patients with long Covid,” said Dr. Janna Friedly, executive director of the UW Medicine Post-Covid Rehabilitation and Recovery Clinic.
Friedly said the heat tends to exacerbate symptoms for her patients.
Susie Rantz, a long covid patient at the post-covid clinic, said that was the case for her.
She got Covid-19 very early in the pandemic, in March 2020.
Rantz wasn’t hospitalized but she experienced severe chest pain, shortness of breath, a cough, and fatigue.
“I don’t think I’ve ever felt that tired in my life,” Rantz said.
She recovered.
But the fatigue lingered, as did some other symptoms.
Rantz now has issues with her autonomic nervous system, which regulates things like heart rate and blood pressure.
As a result, when she stands, her body has a hard time moving blood back up to her brain.
“So now I have blood at my feet that’s not getting to my head, and a racing heart rate when I’m not even doing any exercising.”
When the heat wave hit this past week Rantz said everything got worse.
The high temperatures meant bad headaches, more fatigue, and more breathing issues for her.
“I really, as much as possible, tried to sit down ... and tried to find really cool areas,” Rantz said.
Prior to Covid, Rantz didn’t have any health conditions.
Now, she said, she has to pay much more attention to her body.
“Knowing that we’re going to have 90-degree temperatures in Seattle for years to come and that’s going to be regular, you have to just think a lot differently about what you can and can’t do,” Rantz said.
Things like a trip to the beach with friends wouldn’t have required much forethought before the pandemic.
Rantz said she’s lucky enough to have a window air conditioning unit in the bedroom, so she spent time last week sitting in bed right in front of it when she could.
But she’s aware not everyone has an AC unit to camp out in front of, and some people have more severe long Covid symptoms.
Millions of Americans are estimated to be experiencing long Covid.
Friedly said that number is likely to grow as highly contagious subvariants sweep through the country and more people become infected.
“You couple that with the changes in climate and more extreme heat that we're experiencing across the country, and across the world, and I think the issues are going to compound themselves,” she said.
“It's extremely concerning to us."

Editor's note: Information on the COVID-19 crisis is constantly changing.
For the latest numbers and updates, keep checking the CDC's website.
For the most up-to-date information from Michigan Medicine, visit the hospital's Coronavirus (COVID-19) webpage.
It's happened, or at least you think it has.
The tiny coronavirus that's causing big problems around the world has made it into your home.
Someone you live with is sick and you think it's COVID-19.
They need your help, but you don't want to get sick too, or pass the virus to others.
What can you do?
Even if you don't yet know for sure, assume they have COVID until you can get them tested.-
With current high levels of COVID cases in the U.S., if they're running a fever, have a sore throat, hacking away with a 'dry' cough, have a runny nose, or are feeling super tired or have aches for no apparent reason, it's quite possible they do have COVID.
Some other symptoms include nausea diarrhea and suddenly losing their sense of smell or taste.
Fully vaccinated people, and even people who have had a booster dose of vaccine, can still catch coronavirus and develop symptoms, though the vaccine offers strong protection against severe cases.
It's also possible to test positive for COVID without having symptoms; such people still need to follow precautions because they can spread the virus to others who might be more vulnerable than them.
SEE ALSO: Are Digestive Issues a Symptom of COVID-19?
First: Call the person's regular doctor's office, if they have one, to report the symptoms.
If they have any serious underlying health conditions, are pregnant or are taking medications that weaken their immune system, the doctor's office may offer specific advice.
Now, make a plan to get them tested.
If you have a rapid antigen test already on hand, or you can get one from a store or health department, use it first – they are most accurate for mildly symptomatic people.
Be sure to follow the directions closely, as most tests are not one and done – the packages contain two cards, designed for one person to test twice within a few days.
If the rapid test is positive, or if you can't easily get a rapid test, it's time to help them get to a PCR testing location.
Pharmacies, health departments and hospitals or health systems all offer testing; most ask you to make an appointment but you may also find drive-up options.
No matter what, make sure they, and you, wear a mask over both mouth and nose when you're taking them.
Keep the window of the car open a bit to let air circulate.
While you're waiting for their PCR test results, which could take one to three days, you're better off taking the same precautions at home that you would take if you knew for sure that they had the virus.
You should also alert people who were near them in recent days, because they are now at risk of getting sick and spreading the virus.
If the first rapid test was negative, it's best to take precautions until it's time to take the second test in the kit.
Even if they test negative again, and they just have a plain old cold or the flu, it's best to avoid spreading it to the rest of the household.
Follow these COVID-19 ground rules without fail:
Put the person who has COVID, or is waiting for test results, in isolation within the home.
Keep reading for more about that.
You, and everyone the sick person lives with or was recently with, are now considered a close contact of a person with COVID.
Read what that means depending on each person's vaccination status or past COVID history and whether they develop symptoms or not.
Don't go in the same room as the sick person unless they, and you, have covered both mouth and nose with a mask.
The masks should fit snugly and be several layers if they are cloth; surgical masks or KN95 masks offer more protection.
Except when you need to check on them or bring them something, stay out of the same room as them, and give them a dedicated space with a door that closes.
Keep air circulating into their space, by cracking open a window.
If possible, set up a fan pointing out the window, or use an air filtering device that you buy or make.
Make sure the sick person coughs into their mask or cloth, or their elbow or a tissue, to keep virus particles out of the air.
Dispose of tissues after one use.
Clean your hands often and thoroughly with soap or alcohol rub.
Clean surfaces with soap or disinfectants.
Don't touch your face unless you've just cleaned your hands.
You can safely help them cope with their symptoms at home, while protecting yourself and anyone else you live with.
"When you're living with someone who you think or know has COVID-19, you should support them physically and emotionally, while at the same time avoiding getting close, touching them or touching things they have touched that haven't been cleaned yet," says Tammy Chang, M.D., M.P.H., M.S., assistant professor of Family Medicine at Michigan Medicine.
"And be sure to check on them often, either by phone or without entering their room all the way, because they can take a turn for the worse very quickly.
"
If you know someone who lives alone and has symptoms, ask if you can help with some of these same things without entering their home more than needed.
Check on them frequently by phone or text, and offer to drop off food, medicines or things to help make them comfortable.
Know the COVID-19 danger signs, and what to do if they happen:
For most unvaccinated people, a coronavirus infection will lay them low for a couple of weeks.
Vaccinated people will likely have a milder course of illness.
Talk to their regular doctor about what to expect, but if you or someone you live with or know has these symptoms, it's time to seek emergency care:
Trouble breathing
Chest pain or pressure that doesn't go away
Confusion or can't be woken up
Blue color in their lips or face
If they, or you, have a higher risk of developing a severe case of COVID-19, be especially watchful for these symptoms.
Caring for a COVID-19 patient at home
Think like a combination of nurse and hotel room service.
For more than 100 years, nurses and other health care workers have followed basic steps to take care of people with contagious diseases, while protecting themselves from infections.
If someone you live with has COVID-19 symptoms but isn't sick enough to need a hospital, or even if they have tested positive on a PCR test and have no symptoms, now it's your turn to provide "supportive care" while protecting your health.
Here are 14 ways how:
Pick a 'sick room' for them to isolate in: The sick person should stay in a bedroom with a door if at all possible, and not come out except to go to the bathroom.
No one else should spend time in that room more than absolutely necessary.
Children and pets should stay out.
Keep a window open in the sick room if possible, to keep air circulating.
Provide tissues.
If you don't have more than one bedroom, give them the bedroom, and you can sleep on the couch or other temporary spot like an inflatable mattress, so you can still use the living room, kitchen and other spaces while they stay in their room.
Pick a 'sick bathroom': If you have two bathrooms, make one of them the sick person's bathroom, and don't let anyone else use it.
If you don't have two, open windows, run the ventilation fan if you have one, and clean every surface they touch after they go to the bathroom, so it's clean when you or other people you live with need to use it.
(see cleaning tips below.)
And don't share water cups.
Help them track their symptoms: Have them take their temperature several times a day, without getting close to them.
Write down the readings, and note when new symptoms occur.
Help them hydrate: Make sure they're drinking a lot of water and other non-alcoholic clear liquids.
Ease their symptoms: Help them understand how often they can take medicine to reduce their fever, like acetaminophen and ibuprofen.
Make sure the sick person understands how much to take – read the label on the bottle and follow it.
If they have a bad cough, help them understand how much cough medicine to take and when.
Don't let them take more than the recommended dose of any medicine, or use alcohol when taking a medicine that advises against it.
Keep track of what the sick person has taken and when.
Make sure they keep taking any other medicines they would usually take, unless their doctor has told them to stop.
Keep them comfortable and entertained, while keeping your distance: Make sure they have blankets and pillows, books, magazines, and a computer or TV to pass the time, and a charger for their phone near their bed, so you don't have to go in and out of the room.
Keep the house or apartment quiet so they can sleep.
Help them with food, but keep your distance: Find a tray or cookie sheet that you can use to bring them food or drinks when they need it.
If they can get out of bed: Put the food and drinks on the tray, and place it outside their closed door.
Walk away.
They can open the door, get the tray, eat in their room, and then put the tray back on the floor outside the door and close it.
If they can't easily get out of bed:
Wear a mask over your mouth and nose when you go in their room, and have them cover theirs too.
Bring their food and drink to their bedside table, and go back after a while to pick it up again, wearing a mask again.
Wash their dishes thoroughly with hot water and soap.
Wash your hands thoroughly after you touch anything they ate or drank from.
Keep their laundry separate: Bring changes of clothes and pajamas to them if they're not already in the sick room.
Get your clothes out of the sick room if they're usually stored there.
Make sure they have a basket, hamper or bag in the sick room to put clothes, towels, washcloths and bedding in.
Have them put it outside their door when it's full, or wear a mask over your mouth and nose when you go in to get it.
Wash their clothes, towels and bedding separately from anyone else's.
Clean and ventilate the home: The virus can linger in the air, and on surfaces.
Clean everything the sick person might have touched or worn when they were in the early stages of getting sick, or when they were contagious before developing symptoms.
Even if they are in their own room with the door closed most of the time, keep windows open slightly in other parts of the home to create ventilation.
Run the fan on your heating/cooling system, and use a freestanding fan pointed at an open window to move air out.
Say no to visitors: You shouldn't be having guests over when someone in the house has a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19.
You also shouldn't have people working inside your home.
If you have to see someone in person, do it outside your home, preferably outdoors, and stay at least six feet away from them.
If they're bringing you something, ask them to put it down and step away so you can pick it up.
Use technology to connect: It may seem silly to do a video chat, text message or voice call with someone in the next room, but it can give the sick person human contact with you, your children or pets, and others in the home, without spreading the virus.
Make sure they can connect virtually with others, too – including relatives, friends, coworkers and faith organizations.
This can ease the awfulness of being sick and stuck in one room.
Stay home yourself: Now that you and others in your home have had contact with someone who has or might have COVID-19, you could carry the virus with you to work, to gatherings, or to the store, even if you don't have symptoms.
Everyone the sick person lives with, or spent time with in the days before they developed symptoms or tested positive, is considered a "close contact" of a person with COVID-19.
This is true even for people who are fully vaccinated and have had a booster dose of vaccine, and for people who had COVID themselves in the past few months.
Close contacts should follow guidance about quarantining, testing and masking from the CDC .
That guidance varies depending on vaccination status.
If you are caring for or living with a person with suspected or known COVID, contact your own doctor if you have special risk factors that could put you at risk of severe COVID (such as a medical condition, pregnancy or advanced age).
Plan to order delivery from restaurants and grocery stores, or ask friends or family if they are able to shop for you, and leave the items outside your front door.
If those options aren't available, wear a mask over your mouth and nose and make as few trips as possible.
If you have a yard, garden, patio, balcony or porch, spend time there to get outdoors, but stay six feet away from anyone who doesn't live with you.
Don't be afraid to ask for help or moral support: It's OK to let friends, neighbors and family know that someone you live with is sick, and to seek and accept their help while not letting them near the sick person.
You don't have to tell your whole social media network, but at least tell a few people you can rely on.
And definitely tell anyone who was in close contact (15 minutes or more in the same room) with the sick person in the three days before their symptoms began, so that those people can follow CDC advice too.
Friends, relatives and neighbors can bring you supplies from the 'outside world' and leave them on your doorstep, or ship them to you.
Don't forget that you need emotional support and connection to help you get through your time as a COVID-19 caregiver.
As the nation works to fight the spread of the virus, and care for the sick, we're all affected in some way.
But connecting with one another in safe ways can help us cope.
After they're better: Someone who has had COVID-19, whether they got tested or not, should stay home and away from others until they meet the following criteria: CDC guidelines state that if you think or know someone has had COVID-19, they can be with others only after they've been fever-free, without medication, for 24 hours AND their respiratory symptoms have improved (this includes coughing or shortness of breath) AND it has been 10 days since their symptoms first appeared.
The CDC also states that people who have been around someone with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should stay home for 10 to 14 days after that exposure unless they are fully vaccinated or had COVID themselves in the last 90 days .
People who remain without symptoms and test negative on a test of their own may be able to "test out" of quarantine sooner
If anyone else in the household develops COVID-like symptoms or tests positive while the first person is still sick or recovering, the 'quarantine clock' starts again for everyone in the home who has not gotten sick or tested positive.
After the quarantine and isolation periods end for everyone in the home, you, and they, should do a thorough cleaning of the 'sick room', including wiping down all hard surfaces, washing bedding including blankets, and vacuuming.
Air out the entire home well.
And anyone in the home who is eligible for vaccination or a booster dose of vaccine may go get vaccinated as soon as their quarantine or isolation period has ended – even the sick person as long as their symptoms are gone.
The exception: If anyone's doctor advised them to get monoclonal antibody therapy, and they received it because they had COVID or have extra risk factors, they should not go for any further vaccination until 90 days after this treatment.

Coronavirus is a new virus scientists are learning more about as time goes on.
And people are reacting differently to the same pathogen.
One Scottish woman felt her brain "short circuiting" after contracting the virus.
The lady from East Lothian, Scotland, shared details of her experience on social media.
Posting on a local Facebook group, Tracey Binnie revealed she had been infected with the virus.
Not only that, Tracey particularly wanted to seek support from other survivors about the strange symptom she's still encountering.
Headache is said to be one of the most common neurological symptoms of COVID-19 that could linger on even after all the other symptoms have disappeared.
A 2020 study found that out of 130 participants positive with COVID-19, 74.6 percent had mild to moderate headaches.
One-quarter of the patients had severe migraine-like headaches and it was noted that it was one of the earliest symptoms to appear.
Another study published in PubMed Central found that people who had COVID headaches developed tension headaches.
Some of the characteristics include:
- Moderate to severe pain
- Pain on both sides of the head
- Pain around the forehead including sides of the head and around the eyes
- Tightness or pulsing sensation
- Little response to OTC medications
The study also notes that a quarter of the participants experience headaches resembling a migraine.
Symptoms include throbbing pain usually on one side of the head along with nausea and vomiting and a sensivity to light, smell, or touch.
To date, only one small survey has investigated the actual condition of Long COVID or COVID-19 sequelae in the Japanese population19, and Long COVID is poorly understood in Japan.
Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, only a few studies have conducted a large-scale investigation globally regarding COVID-19 sequelae, and no study has examined the risk factors for each persisting symptom separately.
We assessed the duration and severity of each persisting symptom; and identified the sequelae that have long-term effects on the QOL.
Of the study participants, 56.1% had one or more sequelae at the time of completing the questionnaire, approximately 1 year (median) post-infection.
According to a report from Italy, 87.4% of infected individuals had one or more sequelae 2 months after infection16.
Similarly, a report from China suggested that some symptoms persisted in 76% of infected individuals 6 months post-infection18.
Considering the long duration of symptoms in our study compared to these studies, a slightly lower prevalence of sequelae may be reasonable.
If the severity of the symptoms is not considered, even > 50% of infected participants with mild COVID-19 has one or more sequelae (Table 2).
Furthermore, the prevalence of Long COVID was similar in the Mild and Severe groups, showing that Long COVID is not dependent on the initial disease severity.
The distribution of symptoms differed between the acute phase and 1-year post-infection.
This tendency was similar regardless of COVID-19 severity.
Comparing the distribution of sequelae at the time of answering the questionnaire in the Mild group, Severe group, and overall, the distribution was similar; fatigue, alopecia, concentration problems, memory problems, and sleeplessness persisted among ≥ 10% of participants.
In a previous report, fatigue, cough, red eyes, and dyspnea were observed in > 30% of participants 2–3 weeks after COVID-19 onset15.
Similarly, in a survey conducted 4–8 weeks post-COVID-19 onset, fatigue, dyspnea, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression, and concentration problems persisted in > 30% of patients in the intensive care unit and general ward17.
Furthermore, in a study of patients 6 months after COVID-19 onset, fatigue was the most common persistent symptom, persisting among ≥ 60% of participants, and sleep disorders and alopecia persisted among ≥ 20% of participants18.
Consistent with previous studies16,22,23, fatigue was the most common persistent symptom in our study.
Other symptoms varied among studies—they might be influenced by the time of the study, the epidemic strain of SARS-CoV-2, and ethnicity.
Regarding the effects of each persistent symptom on the QOL, we considered the symptom severity score of 3–4 to be the most influential.
In both Mild and Severe groups, many participants had severe symptoms of alopecia, concentration problems, memory problems, sleeplessness, and joint pain (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3).
Symptoms that strongly manifested in the Mild group were also strongly exhibited in the Severe group.
Additionally, in the Severe group, persistent cough, sputum production, fatigue, dyspnea, lack of appetite, red eyes, and diarrhea affected the QOL.
Thus, more severe COVID-19 is associated with a greater diversity of sequelae affecting the QOL.
Moreno-Pérez et al.22 analyzed risk factors for COVID-19 sequelae and detected no significant risk factors.
This may be because the investigators did not consider the risk factors separately for each symptom Therefore, we analyzed the factors related to each persistent symptom.
Persistent sputum production and dyspnea were strongly related to the severity of COVID-19 (Fig. 3).
Further, although the OR was low for cough, it was one of the most common respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 and was associated with the severity of the disease.
The higher the severity of COVID-19, the greater the organic damage caused to the lungs, and the severity may be strongly associated with these respiratory sequelae.
According to previous studies, more severe COVID-19 is associated with a decrease in the residual air volume and diffusivity18.
Furthermore, people with dyspnea have low forced vital capacity, low forced expiratory volume in 1 s and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, and restrictive ventilatory patterns24.
Greater severity and severe acute organic lung damage may cause the persistence of respiratory symptoms.
In addition to respiratory symptoms, chest pain, sore throat, and diarrhea were closely associated with COVID-19 severity and sequelae.
The association between gastrointestinal symptoms and COVID-19 may be due to disturbances in the immune system and intestinal flora25, and diarrhea has previously been reported to be associated with COVID-19 severity26.
Patients with more severe COVID-19 may develop sequelae because of long-term immune system activation and disturbances in the intestinal flora.
Myocardial inflammation has been reported to persist for up to 71 days post-COVID-19 and may be associated with long-term chest pain27.
It is unknown whether sore throat is caused by Long COVID.
Hence, further research is needed to explain the direct causal relationship between diarrhea and sore throat as sequelae and COVID-19 severity.
Fatigue, dysgeusia, anosmia, alopecia, and sleeplessness as sequelae were not related to COVID-19 severity.
It has previously been reported that fatigue is not associated with COVID-19 severity28.
Thus, individuals such as, young individuals, those without any underlying disease, vaccinated individuals, and those with a previous history of COVID-19, may experience these sequelae, despite being at low risk of developing severe disease.
Therefore, preventing infection is important until there is treatment available for specific COVID-19 sequelae.
In the context of recovery time from symptoms of fatigue, alopecia, and sleeplessness, it was observed that many patients (over 50%) did not recover from their symptoms even after ≥ 1 year of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
These symptoms were unrelated to COVID-19 severity, suggesting that even mildly ill individuals may experience sequelae over a long period.
Hence, attention should be paid to sequelae of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, which has been dominant in 2022 and is considered highly infectious and mildly severe29,30,31.
Our study has some limitations.
First, it was a cross-sectional study; thus, the time from disease occurrence to investigation varied among patients, and patients could have been infected with different viral strains or variants.
We could not investigate the infecting strain in each patient.
Second, selection bias could affect the participant’s willingness to participate, and recall bias may be involved in the severity of sequelae symptoms32.
People with Long COVID are more likely to participate in questionnaire studies about COVID-19 sequelae.
Conversely, people without sequelae are more likely to be uninterested in the study and, consequently, may not have participated.
Further, we may have overestimated the prevalence of COVID-19 sequelae.
Accuracy of memory and recall may also vary among participants for acute symptoms.
Finally, although we obtained new findings on risk factors for COVID-19 sequelae, it is difficult to propose countermeasures to prevent the sequelae of COVID-19 besides infection prevention and control.
In conclusion, this study revealed a high prevalence of sequelae approximately 1 year after COVID-19.
Fatigue, dysgeusia, anosmia, alopecia, and sleeplessness as sequelae of COVID-19 can affect the QOL, even in individuals with asymptomatic or mild disease, and the sequelae are prolonged.
Thus, preventing COVID-19 is important even among individuals who are not at the risk of severe disease.
Delaware Public Media’s Rachel Sawicki examines the effects of long COVID and how it's being addressed Listen • 11:26
“I was very healthy before I got COVID,” says long COVID patient Faith Newton.
“I swam half a mile every other day, I walked two miles, I could bike 20 to 25 miles on the weekends, like I was in really good shape, so it was a shock that I got this sick.”
Newton is one of the over 28% of Delawareans that report long-COVID symptoms according to the National Center for Health Statistics.
Delaware ranks 17th in the nation for patients experiencing long-COVID.
But Dr. Sarah Schenck, medical director of Virtualist Medicine for ChristianaCare's Center for Virtual Health, notes cases like Newton’s are only what is reported and it is likely that there is underreporting in every state.
“We have patients who weren't even aware they had COVID,” Schenck says.
“Either they didn’t have access to a test or it was a false negative, and they go on to develop long-COVID symptoms.
It doesn’t mean, just because they never had a positive COVID test that they can’t have long-COVID.”
Schenck defines long COVID as COVID patients who go on to develop new symptoms or have lingering symptoms at least 4 weeks after an acute infection.
Schenck says it is more likely for unvaccinated patients and those who had severe COVID and were hospitalized to develop long-COVID symptoms, but it can happen to anyone, even people who were asymptomatic, or didn’t know they had COVID in the first place.
“It’s like you got the flu 24/7.
You can’t remember what you did 20 minutes ago.
And you can’t remember simple things like 3 times 4 is 12, or you can’t recall certain words.”
Faith Newton, long COVID patient
As for what long-COVID looks like in patients – what they know so far is it can affect any system in the body.
“So it can affect the lungs and cause respiratory issues like troubling breathing or cough, it can affect the brain and that’s how it causes brain fog, trouble thinking o processing, trouble finding words, trouble with short-term memory, trouble with multitasking, that’s actually a complaint that we hear not uncommonly in our clinic, patients who are used to always multitasking really have trouble with that,” Schenck says.
What they’re learning now is how long COVID affects those systems.
Schenck says the most common symptoms are fatigue, brain fog, and exercise tolerance.
“Going up and down a flight of stairs may cause issues with breathing or the heart beating fast or feeling kind of dizzy,” she says.
She adds that issues with smell and taste, sleep disorders, depression, and anxiety are also on the long list of signs.
Newton is experiencing just about every symptom that Schenck lists, plus hair and weight loss.
She started developing those symptoms in May 2022 and has been sick ever since – despite completing her initial vaccine series and receiving two booster shots.
She’s no stranger to these symptoms.
Her son has Myalgic Encephalomyelitis – more widely known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and called ME/CFS – which is closely related with long-COVID symptoms.
When she first got sick, Newton says fatigue was her worst symptom.
She slept nearly 18 hours every day, and it hasn’t gotten much better.
She also has severe brain fog.
“It’s like you got the flu 24/7,” Newton says.
“You can’t remember what you did 20 minutes ago.
And you can’t remember simple things like 3 times 4 is 12, or you can’t recall certain words.”
She has also drastically changed her diet to dairy-free, gluten-free, and low-histamine.
“You put leftovers in the refrigerator and they grow histamines,” Newton says.
“And in my case, I get the doggone hives the next day.”
She visits the COVID clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and is currently seeking a second opinion at Philadelphia’s Thomas Jefferson University Hospital on her stomach issues.
She’s losing about 2 pounds a week and is severely dehydrated, so she sits at ChristianaCare’s infusion center twice a week for four to five hours a day to replace those lost fluids.
Newton is a professor of education at Delaware State University, and often teaches virtually, which she says is still stressful.
“Everything that I do costs energy,” Newton says.
“Then I have to recover that energy somehow.
And then I can’t overuse that energy.
It has upended my entire life.
It has been unbelievable.”
She is part of a long-haulers support group at Johns Hopkins and a group for people with ME/CFS who have also accepted people with long-COVID who have developed ME/CFS symptoms.
She says a lot of people join these groups to seek guidance on how to deal with their symptoms.
“And a lot of people, they don’t know what to do with the depression and anxiety, and don’t know it’s a side effect of long-COVID, and for whatever reason, their doctors are not educating them on that,” Newton says.
“Our group will tell them they need to go see their doctor and see if they need to be on some kind of anti-anxiety or anti-depressant.”
“The public health officials are kind of posturing towards, ‘the pandemic is over.'
That’s very much not in alignment with what I’m experiencing with the need out there that people have after they get a COVID infection.”
Andrew Wylam, President of Pandemic Patients
Charonda Johnson can attest that support groups are essential for people with long-COVID.
She’s the Strategic Partnerhsip manager for COVID Survivors for Change, a national nonprofit that started as a support group for people who lost friends and family to COVID, but over time developed into a resource for people with long-COVID.
“Unfortunately, I don't think most of America is talking about this, or is even really concerned or aware that this could potentially affect lots of people,” Johnson says.
“And in particular, lots of people that have long-covid.”
Johnson’s father caught COVID leading worship in church in July 2020, and was dead in less than a month.
She connected with Survivors for Change to share her story, and has since dedicated herself to advocacy and awareness.
“We try to kind of unify in, ‘how do we support people who are affected by long COVID?’” she says.
“Because there is no calvary coming to save them.
We are the Calvary.”
Johnson emphasizes that support groups should not replace real medical professionals and their advice, but they do provide a sounding board for those struggling.
Andrew Wylam is the President of Pandemic Patients, a nonprofit patient advocacy organization founded in May 2021.
Wylam has a background in law and has a pandemic legal assistance network that provides pro bono legal services to people affected by COVID.
Wylam says they’ve taken a close focus on the intersection between long COVID, disability, and employment.
“That is the real epicenter of where this issue is continuing to explode in this country, where people get COVID and they may recover or they may stay sick, whatever path they go on, but at some point, they find that their symptoms are so disabling that they have to stop working or they find that they can’t work anymore the way that they are used to,” Wylam says.
In 2021, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice put out guidance as to when long-COVID is a disability – typically, when symptoms become so severe that they limit one or more of your major life activities.
“If someone says, ‘Oh I have long COVID and I’m tired,’ or ‘I have some brain fog,’ it’s like, that’s on the spectrum of maybe not disabling under the law,” Wylam says.
“But when you get to the point where someone has difficulty breathing or difficulty walking or difficulty driving because they have severe nausea and vertigo, that is what can push them over the line towards being a disability under federal law.”
According to a survey by the FDA that Pandemic Patients is helping to collect data for, post-exertional symptom exacerbation is extremely common – when someone can push themselves in the moment but will later crash, and are often bed-bound for days, and experience cognitive impairment like focus and communication.
But Wylam says employers are sometimes skeptical – there is no test for long-COVID.
“The public health officials are kind of posturing towards, ‘the pandemic is over,’”
Wylam says.
“That’s very much not in alignment with what I’m experiencing with the need out there that people have after they get a COVID infection.”
Johnson says that’s where support groups can also help – identifying those who still have needs and who are getting left behind when the health emergency is declared over.
She says more than 1.1 million people have died and that 81% of Americans know someone who has been hospitalized or died from COVID.
“And we tried to put those numbers in terms that people could really think about,” Johnson says.
“What that looks like, that means 1000 people died every single day.
That’s one person dying every 80 seconds in America.”
Johnson herself is dealing with long-COVID now.
She says at first, she didn’t realize that things like vision and balance issues were symptoms of long-COVID, until someone else revealed they were having the same issues.
“We don’t know what the long-term effects are five, 10, 20 years out, it hasn’t been around long enough for us to know that.
So I think that is on the horizon.”
Dr. Sarah Schenck, medical director of Virtualist Medicine for ChristianaCare's Center for Virtual Health
“People who had long-COVID specifically, it wasn’t my doctors, it was other patients who had long-COVID who were telling me ‘these are the things you need to do to advocate for yourself,’” she says.
Schenck says the biggest question still unanswered is just how long is long-COVID?
“We don’t know what the long-term effects are five, 10, 20 years out, it hasn’t been around long enough for us to know that,” Schenck says.
“So I think that is on the horizon.”
She says the clinical team at ChristianaCare’s Symptom Monitoring and Virtual Care Program try to treat the root of the symptoms, but there is no one answer to every patient’s problems.
And while they’ve treated more than 500 patients so far, she is sure there are more out there.
“I think it’s a lot of patients, but I think there’s a lot more out there that probably don’t know about this clinic,” Schenck says.
“They don’t know how to find us, so I think we could be helping even more.”
And for those who get treatment - Schenck offers a glimmer of hope.
“Most of our patients get better,” she says.
An outcome Newton believes is in her future.
“I am a very positive person,” Newton says.
“I will get well, it’s just a matter of finding the right clinician who knows how to deal with the issues that I have.”
Being sick, whether with a cold or covid-19, changes your voice in a variety of ways.
Now MIT Lincoln Laboratory researchers have found that processing speech signals may reveal such changes in covid-19 patients before the effects can be heard, potentially offering a way to identify asymptomatic cases.
Thomas Quatieri of the laboratory’s Human Health and Performance Systems Group had previously used signal processing to detect indicators of disease in the speech of people with neurological disorders such as ALS and Parkinson’s.
Thinking about the symptoms of covid-19, he and his colleagues reasoned that inflammation and breathing difficulties would be likely to affect the loudness, pitch, steadiness, and resonance of patients’ voices, perhaps before obvious symptoms developed.
So they combed YouTube for interviews celebrities who’d tested positive for covid-19 had given while presumed asymptomatic.
Then they downloaded older interviews with the same people and used algorithms to extract vocal features from each audio sample.
The results suggest that the disease’s impact on muscle movement in the respiratory tract, the larynx, and articulatory features like the tongue, lips, and jaw causes subtle voice changes.
The team is now working to validate the data and, with Satra Ghosh at the McGovern Institute, exploring ways to use it in mobile apps for screening.
They also hope to consider neurophysiological impacts linked to covid-19, like the loss of taste and smell, Quatieri says: “Those symptoms can affect speaking too.”
Doctors at Boston Children’s describe 75 croup cases and offer advice for parents.

During the Omicron surge, pediatricians and emergency departments (EDs) began noticing something new: a surge in croup among infants and young children.
Marked by a distinctive “barking” cough and sometimes noisy, high-pitched intakes of breath, croup can happen when colds and other viral infections cause the voice box, windpipe, and bronchial tubes to become inflamed and swollen.
Doctors at Boston Children’s decided to take stock, looking back at their records of children with croup and COVID-19.
In a report in the journal Pediatrics, they provide the first rigorous description of COVID-19-related croup, reviewing the cases of 75 children who came to the ED.
The review extended back to the beginning of the pandemic, but 80 percent of the children arrived during the Omicron surge.
“There was a very clear spike when Omicron became the dominant variant,” says study leader Dr. Ryan Brewster, a resident in the Boston Combined Residency Program in Pediatrics.
A snapshot of COVID croup
Some of the croup cases at Boston Children’s were surprisingly severe, requiring more medication doses than usual and prompting more hospital admissions than expected.
In keeping with the usual pattern of croup, most of the children were under age 2, and about 70 percent were boys.
Except for one child with a common cold virus, none had a viral infection other than COVID-19.
Although no children died, nine of the children (12 percent) were struggling to breathe and needed to be hospitalized.
Four of the nine (44 percent) required intensive care.
By comparison, before COVID-19, fewer than 5 percent of children with croup were hospitalized, according to a medical review.
Of those, only 1 to 3 percent needed to be intubated.
“Most cases of croup can be treated in the ED or pediatrician’s office with the steroid dexamethasone and supportive care,” Dr. Brewster says.
“Our relatively high rate of hospitalization and the number of treatments hospitalized kids needed — an average of six doses of dexamethasone and eight treatments with nebulized epinephrine — suggests that COVID-19 might cause more severe croup than other viruses.
We need more research to determine the best treatment options for these children.”
Why are all these cases of COVID-19 croup cropping up?
Evidence from several laboratory studies suggests that the Omicron variant mainly attacks the upper airway — the throat and bronchial tubes — whereas earlier strains mainly targeted the lungs, says Dr. Brewster.
While these studies were in animals, it seems likely that the same is true for people.
What if my child has croup?
You can care for mild croup at home by sitting with your child while they breathe cool mist from a humidifier or steam from a hot shower for 15-20 minutes.
A favorite song or book can help ease your child’s anxiety, which can worsen croup symptoms.
But the following signs should prompt a call to your pediatrician, and possibly a visit to the emergency department:
frequent noisy inhalations and barking cough at rest (when your child is calm and not moving around)
clear struggles to breathe: sucking in the breastbone or ribs, using the belly muscles to help take breaths, flaring the nostrils
increased fatigue or sleepiness
blue lips or blue finger tips
a temperature higher than 100.4°F for more than three days
symptoms of mild croup lasting longer than seven days
If my child has croup, does that mean they also have COVID-19?
It’s possible.
“While many viruses can cause croup, you should also consider the possibility that your child has COVID-19,” says Dr. Jonathan Mansbach, who is chief of Hospital Medicine at Boston Children’s and oversaw the study.
“Consider getting testing them and other family members tested, especially if there’s reason to think they’ve been exposed.”

If you become ill with COVID-19, your smartwatch can track the progression of your symptoms, and could even show how sick you become.
That’s according to a University of Michigan study that examined the effects of COVID-19 with six factors derived from heart rate data.
The same method could be used to detect other diseases such as influenza, and the researchers say the approach could be used to track disease at home or when medical resources are scarce, such as during a pandemic or in developing countries.
Their results are published in the journal Cell Reports Medicine.
Following U-M students and medical interns throughout the country, the researchers discovered new signals embedded in heart rate indicating when individuals were infected with COVID and how sick they became.
The researchers found that individuals with COVID experienced an increase in heart rate per step after symptom onset, and those with a cough had a much higher heart rate per step than those without a cough.
“We found that COVID dampened biological timekeeping signals, changed how your heart rate responds to activity, altered basal heart rate and caused stress signals,” said Daniel Forger, professor of mathematics and research professor of computational medicine and bioinformatics.
“What we realized was knowledge of physiology, how the body works and mathematics can help us get more information from these wearables.”
The researchers found that these measures were significantly altered and could show symptomatic vs. healthy periods in the wearers’ lives.
“There’s been some previous work on understanding disease through wearable heart rate data, but I think we really take a different approach by focusing on decomposing the heart rate signal into multiple different components to take a multidimensional view of heart rate,” said Caleb Mayer, a doctoral student in mathematics.
“All of these components are based on different physiological systems.
This really gives us additional information about disease progression and understanding how disease impacts these different physiological systems over time.”
Participants were drawn from the 2019 and 2020 cohorts of the Intern Health Study, a multisite cohort study that follows physicians across several institutes in their first year of residency.
Researchers also used information from the Roadmap College Student Data Set, a study that examined student health and well-being during the 2020-21 academic year using wearable data from Fitbits, self-reported COVID-19 diagnoses and symptom information, and publicly available data.
For this analysis, the researchers included individuals who reported a COVID-positive test, symptoms and had wearable data from 50 days before symptom onset to 14 days after.
In all, the researchers used data from 43 medical interns and 72 undergraduate and graduate students.
Specifically, the researchers found:
Heart rate increase per step, a measure of cardiopulmonary dysfunction, increased after symptom onset.
Heart rate per step was significantly higher in participants who reported a cough.
Circadian phase uncertainty, the body’s inability to time daily events, increased around COVID symptom onset.
Because this measure relates to the strength and consistency of the circadian component of the heart rate rhythm, this uncertainty may correspond to early signs of infection.
Daily basal heart rate tended to increase on or before symptom onset.
The researchers hypothesize this was because of fever or heightened anxiety.
Heart rate tended to be more correlated around symptom onset, which could indicate the effects of the stress-related hormone adenosine.
The researchers used an algorithm that was originally developed to estimate daily circadian phase from wearable heart rate and step data.
They looked at a baseline period of 8-35 days before COVID symptom onset and an analysis period defined as 7-14 days around COVID symptom onset.
The researchers hope that with further testing, the same methods could enhance the pre-detection of COVID with wearables.
“The global outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus imposed important public health measures, which impacted our daily lives,” said Sung Won Choi, associate professor of pediatrics.
“However, during this historical event in time, mobile technology offered enormous capabilities—the ability to monitor and collect physiological data longitudinally from individuals noninvasively and remotely.
“We were amazed at the U-M students’ willingness and desire to participate in this study, which was all done remotely, from recruitment to enrollment and onboarding.
The work reported by Mayer and our team was really made possible not only through wearables sensors themselves, but the convergence of novel data analytics, remarkable advances in technology and computing power, and ‘team science’ intersection across research teams.”
This “team science” approach coalesced as a side product of the 2019 U-M Ideas lab, which included the team’s senior investigators.
The researchers say this work establishes algorithms that can be used to understand illnesses’ impact on heart rate physiology, which can form the basis for medical professionals might deploy the use of wearables in health care.
“Identifying the varying patterns of different heart rate parameters derived from wearables across the course of COVID-19 infection is a substantial advance for the field,” said Srijan Sen, professor of psychiatry and director of the Frances and Kenneth Eisenberg and Family Depression Center at U-M. “This work can help us more meaningfully follow populations in future COVID-19 waves.
The study also demonstrates following cohorts with mobile technology and robust data sharing can facilitate unanticipated and valuable discoveries.”
Limitations for the study include that the work does not consider influenza-like illnesses, according to the researchers.
Future work should focus on whether the findings reflect the effects of COVID-19 or whether these effects will persist in other illnesses.
The researchers were also not able to account for the effects of factors such as age, gender or BMI, nor the seasonality effects in the data—that is, whether the data was taken during a period of time where flu or other disease transmission is high.
Co-authors of the study also include U-M researchers Jonathan Tyler, Yu Fang, Christopher Flora, Elena Frank and Muneesh Tewari.
The work was supported by the National Institutes of Health, Human Frontier Science Program, National Science Foundation and a Taubman Institute Innovation Project grant.

Approximately one in four patients with untreated COVID-19 experience symptom relapse, while almost one in three exhibits relapse of viral load, a recent study finds.
These findings offer a natural history of COVID-19 that will inform discussions and research concerning antiviral therapy, lead author Jonathan Z. Li, MD, associate professor of infectious disease at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, both in Boston, and colleagues reported in Annals of Internal Medicine.
Dr. Jonathan Z. Li
“There are increasing reports that high-risk patients are avoiding nirmatrelvir-ritonavir due to concerns about post-Paxlovid rebound, but there remains a gap in our knowledge of the frequency of symptom and viral relapse during untreated natural infection,” Dr. Li said in a written comment.
To address this gap, Dr. Li and colleagues analyzed data from 563 participants from the placebo group of the Adaptive Platform Treatment Trial for Outpatients with COVID-19 (ACTIV-2/A5401).
From days 0-28, patients recorded severity of 13 symptoms, with scores ranging from absent to severe (absent = 0, mild = 1, moderate = 2, severe = 3).
RNA testing was performed on samples from nasal swabs on days 0–14, 21, and 28.
“The symptom rebound definition was determined by consensus of the study team, which comprises more than 10 infectious disease, pulmonary, and critical care physicians, as likely representing a clinically meaningful change in symptoms,” Dr. Li said.
Symptom scores needed to increase by at least 4 points to reach the threshold.
For instance, a patient would qualify for relapse if they had worsening of four symptoms from mild to moderate, emergence of two new moderate symptoms, or emergence of one new moderate and two new mild symptoms.
The threshold for viral relapse was defined by an increase of at least 0.5 log10 RNA copies/mL from one nasal swab to the next, while high-level viral relapse was defined by an increase of at least 5.0 log10 RNA copies/mL. The former threshold was chosen based on previous analysis of viral rebound after nirmatrelvir treatment in the EPIC-HR phase 3 trial, whereas the high-level relapse point was based on Dr. Li and colleagues’ previous work linking this cutoff with the presence of infectious virus.
Their present analysis revealed that 26% of patients had symptom relapse at a median of 11 days after first symptom onset.
Viral relapse occurred in 31% of patients, while high-level viral relapse occurred in 13% of participants.
In about 9 out 10 cases, these relapses were detected at only one time point, suggesting they were transient.
Of note, symptom relapse and high-level viral relapse occurred simultaneously in only 3% of patients.
This lack of correlation was “surprising” and “highlights that recovery from any infection is not always a linear process,” Dr. Li said.
This finding also suggests that untreated patients with recurring symptoms probably pose a low risk of contagion, according to David Wohl, MD, coauthor of the paper and professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Paxlovid may not be to blame for COVID-19 rebound
“These results provide important context for the reports of Paxlovid rebound and show that baseline rates of symptom and viral relapse should be accounted for when studying the risk of rebound after antiviral therapy,” Dr. Li said.
Dr. Wohl suggested that these data can also play a role in conversations with patients who experience rebound after taking antiviral therapy.
“Many who have a return of their symptoms after taking Paxlovid blame the drug, and that may be justified, but this study suggests it happens in untreated people too,” Dr. Wohl said in a written comment.
Longer antiviral therapy deserves investigation
This is a “very important study” because it offers a baseline for comparing the natural history of COVID-19 with clinical course after antiviral therapy, said Timothy Henrich, MD, associate professor in the division of experimental medicine at University of California, San Francisco.
“Unlike this natural history, where it’s kind of sputtering up and down as it goes down, [after antiviral therapy,] it goes away for several days, and then it comes back up; and when it comes up, people have symptoms again,” Dr. Henrich said in an interview.
This suggests that each type of rebound is a unique phenomenon and, from a clinical perspective, that antiviral therapy may need to be extended.
“We treat for too short a period of time,” Dr. Henrich said.
“We’re able to suppress [SARS-CoV-2] to the point where we’re not detecting it in the nasal pharynx, but it’s clearly still there.
And it’s clearly still in a place that can replicate without the drug.”
That said, treating for longer may not be a sure-fire solution, especially if antiviral therapy is started early in the clinical course, as this could delay SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses that are necessary for resolution, Dr. Henrich added,
“We need further study of longer-term therapies,” he said.
Dr. Aditya Shah
An array of research questions need to be addressed, according to Aditya Shah, MBBS, an infectious disease specialist at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn.
In a written comment, he probed the significance of rebound in various clinical scenarios.
“What [type of] rebound matters and what doesn’t?”
Dr. Shah asked.
“Does symptom rebound matter?
How many untreated and treated ‘symptom rebounders’ need additional treatment or health care?
If rebound does not really matter, but if Paxlovid helps in certain unvaccinated and high-risk patients, then does rebound matter?
Future research should also focus on Paxlovid utility in vaccinated but high-risk patients.
Is it as beneficial in them as it is in unvaccinated high-risk patients?”
While potentially regimen-altering questions like these remain unanswered, Dr. Henrich advised providers to keep patients focused on what we do know about the benefits of antiviral therapy given the current 5-day course, which is that it reduces the risk of severe disease and hospitalization.
The investigators disclosed relationships with Merck, Gilead, ViiV, and others.
Dr. Henrich disclosed grant support from Merck and a consulting role with Roche.
Dr. Shah disclosed no conflicts of interest.
This brings the total number of confirmed cases in the outbreak to 142,321, with 123,836 of these still currently active.

Flu-like symptoms have long been the common key marker in those with Covid-19 but now a new symptom has emerged.
Children, and some adults, infected with the virus are increasingly presenting with gastro symptoms, including diarrhoea, vomiting and cramps.
Yesterday, director-general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield confirmed the symptom, particularly in children.
Starship emergency department paediatrician Dr Mike Shepherd says the symptoms are typical of a viral illness in children.
Shepherd said that they are seeing around 30 Covid-positive children in the department each day and that a "reasonable proportion" of them had the gastro symptom.
He said other symptoms concerned parents should look out for includes fluid uptake levels, lethargy, breathing issues and pain that is not able to be managed with paracetamol or ibuprofen.
"What we're trying to reassure people is that Covid is a mild illness in most children, so the things to look out for are really the same things we'd suggest you look out for in any illness in children," said Shepherd.
A Ministry of Health spokesperson said their advice was unchanged and that children should still only get tested if they had flu-like symptoms.
While gastrointestinal symptoms could occur in children with Omicron, a sore throat and runny nose are the most common symptoms, she said.
"Therefore our advice remains the same; keep your child at home if they are sick, get them tested if they have a flu-like illness, and seek medical care if their symptoms worsen.
"
In a video, Starship explained the other symptoms children could have include a lack of appetite, fatigue, tummy pain and muscle aches alongside common symptoms of a runny nose, cough, fever and a headache.

This comes as the child vaccine uptake has stalled - while it started strong, it appears the roll-out began to slow in February.
Fifty per cent of children between the age of 5 and 11 have received one dose.
The percentage of tamariki vaccinated around the country is hugely variable — ranging from 62 per cent in Capital and Coast to just 28 per cent in Northland.
It's nearly been eight weeks since children were able to get their first dose but for most the second round of vaccination has not begun.
Some with special immunity issues have been able to receive the second paediatric dose.
As of yesterday, Ministry of Health data - recorded since August 16, 2021, the start of New Zealand's Delta outbreak - indicates that children aged between 0 and 9 make up for 10 per cent of total cases (113,650).
Those aged between 10 and 19 made up 23 per cent of the total - this is the second-highest percentage among all age groups.
The flu, Covid and respiratory syncytial virus (R.S.V.) have symptoms that overlap — and also can look quite similar to those of the common cold, which is caused by a variety of viruses.
You can develop a cough, fever, headache or runny or stuffy nose with any respiratory virus, said Dr. Michael Chang, an infectious disease specialist at Memorial Hermann Health System in Houston.
One way to differentiate among viral infections is to monitor how quickly your symptoms ramp up.
Symptoms of the flu come on quickly — often just one day after exposure to someone who was sick — and can be felt all over the body.
People with the flu often describe feeling like they’ve been hit by a truck, Dr. Chang said.
With colds, symptoms may take two or three days to appear and are much milder.
Covid and R.S.V. have even longer incubation periods.
It can take an average of five days from exposure to the coronavirus to the development of early Covid-19 symptoms, though newer subvariants like BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 may result in an active infection as soon as three days after exposure.
R.S.V. takes about four to six days.
With Covid and R.S.V., symptoms also build slowly: You may start out feeling sniffly, then develop a cough or a headache the next day and a fever the next.
Adults afflicted with the flu are likely to experience very high fevers, up to 103 or 104 degrees, Dr. Chang said.
But fevers rarely accompany colds, particularly in adults.
People with Covid-19 and R.S.V. experience mild fevers or none at all.
“Especially with the newer variants and people having been exposed through immunization or if they’ve had an infection before, we’re seeing that more patients are now only mildly symptomatic, and they only have low-grade fevers, around 99 or 100,” Dr. Chang said.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday that people who test positive for Covid-19 but have no symptoms should isolate for five days, down from the previous recommendation of 10 days.
The agency attributed the change to growing evidence that the virus is most infectious in the two or three days after symptoms arise.
In addition to cutting the time in half for isolation, the CDC said that for people who are asymptomatic, an additional five days of wearing a mask when around others is recommended.
"Therefore, people who test positive should isolate for five days and, if asymptomatic at that time, they may leave isolation if they can continue to mask for five days to minimize the risk of infecting others," the CDC said in a statement.
The agency also recommended that unvaccinated people or those who are more than six months out from their second mRNA dose and not yet boosted should quarantine for five days after exposure to the virus followed by "strict mask use for an additional 5 days.
"
“The Omicron variant is spreading quickly and has the potential to impact all facets of our society.
CDC’s updated recommendations for isolation and quarantine balance what we know about the spread of the virus and the protection provided by vaccination and booster doses," CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement.
"These updates ensure people can safely continue their daily lives.
Prevention is our best option: get vaccinated, get boosted, wear a mask in public indoor settings in areas of substantial and high community transmission, and take a test before you gather,” she added.
The revised guidance comes as the U.S. sees a surge in Covid cases due in large part to the highly contagious omicron variant.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, told NBC Nightly News that the new guidance takes into account both public health data and worker shortages.
"You have so many people simultaneously testing positive you want to make sure that, particularly among essential workers, that you get people out there much sooner," he said.
"So you can keep people safe from getting infected from you, if you still are infected, but at the same time getting you back to what might be an essential function in society.
"
Fauci added, "On balance, if you look at the safety of the public, and the need to have society not disrupted, this was a good choice."
Last week, the CDC recommended a shortened isolation times for health care workers who test positive but are asymptomatic.
The agency said health care workers can return to work after seven days and a negative test, adding that “isolation time can be cut further if there are staffing shortages."
Health care workers who have received both vaccine doses, including a booster, do not need to quarantine following a high-risk exposure, the CDC said.
Some states have also eased their isolation requirements for essential workers.
Gov. Kathy Hochul announced last week that New York, which has seen a record-breaking surge of cases, is shortening the isolation window to five days for frontline workers to address staffing concerns at businesses.

If you’ve been following COVID news, then you’re likely well aware there’s a new variant in town that’s concerning the scientific community.
Known as XBB, the variant is believed to be the most immune-evasive to date and currently accounts for over 40% of infections in the United States, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
That percentage is expected to grow exponentially in the coming weeks as XBB out-competes other omicron variants like BQ.1.
Look at what transpired in New England: Within three weeks, the percentage of cases in the region caused by XBB jumped from 11% to 75%.

Because XBB is relatively new, scientists are still working to figure out if and how the variant behaves differently from other recent variants.
Though XBB’s symptoms are expected to be on par with past omicron infections, doctors say they are seeing some issues becoming more prevalent than others.
“Viruses typically mutate to become more contagious and less severe; it appears that this is happening with this strain of the coronavirus,” Dr. Henry Redel, the chief of infectious disease at Saint Peter’s University Hospital in New Brunswick, New Jersey, told HuffPost.

We asked infectious disease experts what they’re seeing in the hospital right now.
Here’s what they said:
The most common XBB COVID symptoms appear to be congestion and body aches.
There’s limited data on XBB, but experts suspect the symptoms associated with XBB infections will be similar to the symptoms people experienced with COVID throughout 2022.

That said, evidence has shown that the symptom profile has shifted a bit with each variant.
Omicron caused more cold-like symptoms (like fatigue, runny nose, sneezing and muscle aches), for example, whereas delta and alpha more commonly triggered anosmia (loss of smell) and ageusia (loss of taste).
So, what is on the docket for XBB?
“In general, I think people are more achy and still have congestion and headache,” Dr. Julie Parsonnet, an infectious diseases specialist with Stanford Health Care, told HuffPost.
You may also expect to see the other usual symptoms: fever, chills, cough and sore throat.
Less common symptoms include loss of taste and smell and shortness of breath.
Anosmia and ageusia appear, anecdotally, to be less common with XBB.
Experts don’t expect ageusia and anosmia to make a comeback just yet.
“Since XBB is part of the omicron group, I expect that loss of taste and smell will not be common, but I have not seen data yet,” said Dr. Thomas Campbell, a professor in the department of infectious disease at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.
One thing doctors on the front lines are seeing less of: severe shortness of breath, Redel said.
Rarely have recent patients needed supplemental oxygen, he added.
Redel noted he’s seeing many more COVID patients come in with classic upper respiratory symptoms — like runny nose, congestion and sore throats — along with fever and muscle aches.

What causes symptoms to change between subvariants?
Because so many people have been infected — in some cases, multiple times — it’s tough to pin down exactly how the symptomatology is influenced by the host versus specific traits of the virus.
Parsonnet suspects that immunity plays a pretty big role.
“There is likely a strong element of underlying immunity, but there may also be differences in the virus’s ability to cause symptoms,” Parsonnet told HuffPost.
According to Dr. Martin Krsak, an infectious disease expert at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, people’s genetics and underlying health — i.e. whether they have a chronic disease or prior injury — also influence the type of symptoms they develop.
Like Parsonnet, Krsak said that each variant and the way it infects our cells likely impacts symptoms as well.
“Variants have a different capacity to evade prior immunity and also a different capacity to bind to the main target on human cells,” he said.
Does the latest COVID shot prevent you from getting infected with XBB?
A pre-print study from Japan determined that XBB came to be during the summer of 2022 when two sub-variants of the BA.2 omicron lineage combined.
Scientists believe that, in this process, XBB picked up mutations that help it better evade immunity conferred by both vaccination and previous infections.

XBB’s mutations also let it attach to our cells more easily, enabling it to spread more efficiently than other versions of omicron.
“It binds tighter, appears more transmissible, and is also immune-evasive,” said Dr. Eric M. Poeschla, the head of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.
It’s unknown whether those mutations alter the virus’ clinical profile and the symptoms it causes, Parsonnet said.
The updated COVID shot, which was tweaked in 2022 to target newer variants of omicron, doesn’t work super well at preventing infections of XBB, considering there are so many new infections in the community, Parsonnet said.
But the fact that there hasn’t been a rapid increase in deaths shows that the shots, combined with the immense amount of immunity gained from past infections, continue to protect many people from severe outcomes.
Together, that immunity will help blunt the XBB wave, according to Poeschla.
And though monoclonal antibodies are less effective with XBB, other treatments — including Paxlovid, remdesivir and molnupiravir — appear to hold up well.
Of course, there’s always the very real risk of long COVID, which is a debilitating condition that can follow even a mild case of the coronavirus.
Long COVID can cause lasting fatigue, brain fog, respiratory issues and more.
There’s still a lot for us to learn about XBB and the symptoms or potential complications it may cause.
But there’s one thing we know for sure: There’s a benefit to being vaccinated rather than not.
“The bivalent booster offers some protection against all omicron-based variants and is highly recommended, especially for those over 65 or with serious other risks,” Poeschla said.

With 27 deaths in one day, COVID's latest variant XBB.1.16 has been drawing the attention of health watchers worldwide.
Cases of XBB.1.16 have also been found in the US, but the surge that is seen in India is not seen there.
Until now the symptoms of COVID have remained more or less the same.
Ever since the Omicron variant of the coronavirus took over the Delta variant, the symptoms have remained similar for all its sub variants along with other factors like low severity and low hospitalization rates.
pain in the neck Is a sore throat a symptom of Covid?
CORONAVIRUS has infected millions and with cases continuing to rise, people are curious to know what the symptoms are.
Experts now understand more about the symptoms of Covid-19, with a sore throat a possible sign of infection.
⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news & updates
Is a sore throat a symptom of coronavirus?
A sore throat may be a warning sign of coronavirus infection.
The most common symptoms are a high temperature, a new and continuous cough and loss of taste and small, according to the NHS.
But some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion, aches and pains or diarrhoea.
If the sufferer develops a sore throat it is usually mild and begins gradually.
In some cases, it will be a common cold, rather than Covid-19.
But the advice is, if you start to show signs of being ill, it's best to be safe and isolate.
What should I do if I have a sore throat and a fever or cough?
If you have a sore throat along with any other coronavirus symptoms you should get a test.
A sore throat along with a continuous cough or fever could be a sign you have the virus.
You will need to be tested and tell those you have been in contact with so they can isolate until your results are known.
After a test you should not leave the house until your results are known.
And if you live with others, everyone in the house must stay at home.
If the results are negative you can continue as normal but if positive then you need to self-isolate.
The NHS states if you had a positive test because you had symptoms, keep self-isolating for at least ten days from when your symptoms started.
You should not get a test if you don't have any other Covid symptoms.
What should I do if I only have a sore throat?
If you are worried about symptoms you can go through the NHS 111 online service.
To protect others, do not go to places like a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.
What are the other symptoms of coronavirus?
A high temperature is a common symptom.
This means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back, you do not need to measure your temperature with a thermometer.
A new, continuous, dry cough is also a symptom.
This means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours.
A loss of taste and smell are also recognised as core symptoms of Covid-19 along with a new continuous cough and a high temperature.
Even mild cases of COVID-19 in young people often lead to lingering symptoms and health complications that drag on for six months or longer, according to a small Norwegian study published this week in Nature Medicine.
Researchers at the University of Bergen carefully followed 312 people with confirmed cases of COVID-19 for at least six months.
Of those, 247 had mild to moderate illnesses and isolated at home, never becoming sick enough to be admitted to a hospital.
Six months after testing positive, 136 of the 247 (55 percent) still had lingering symptoms.
And those 136 weren’t only in the older age groups.
In fact, in all the age groups between 16 and over 60 years old, between 50 percent and 60 percent of COVID patients reported persistent symptoms.
For instance, of those between 16 and 30 years old, 52 percent (32 of 61) still suffered COVID-19 symptoms after six months.
The most common symptoms were disturbed taste and/or smell, fatigue, difficulty breathing, difficulty concentrating, and memory problems.
The study is small, and the exact percentages may not hold up in larger studies.
However, it adds to a growing body of data finding that long-term symptoms from COVID-19 are common—even in young people and/or people who had mild or even asymptomatic disease.

In a non-peer-reviewed preprint study posted in March, researchers found that a third of the patients identified through medical records as suffering from so-called “long-haul” COVID-19 had initially reported asymptomatic cases.
The study’s authors, led by researchers in California, tracked the electronic medical records of 1,407 patients who had tested positive for the coronavirus, but these individuals were not sick enough to be hospitalized when they were infected.
Of the 1,407, about 27 percent—382 people—developed long-term symptoms, and a third of them were initially asymptomatic.
Likewise, in another study posted this month, researchers tracked health insurance records of nearly two million people who tested positive for the coronavirus.
The researchers found that about 23 percent of the patients sought care for a new post-COVID medical condition one or more months later.
Of the people who had mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 that didn't require hospitalization, 27 percent experienced persistent symptoms, as did 19 percent of people who initially reported asymptomatic cases.
The authors of the Norwegian study expressed concern about finding mild cases in young people leading to long-term problems.
“It is worrying that non-hospitalized, young people (16–30 years old) suffer potentially severe symptoms, such as concentration and memory problems, dyspnea and fatigue, half a year after infection,” the authors wrote.
“Particularly for students, such symptoms might interfere with their learning and study progress… Considering the millions of young people infected during the ongoing pandemic, our findings are a strong impetus for comprehensive infection control and population-wide mass vaccination.”
More than a year into the pandemic, researchers are still learning more about how COVID-19 attacks the body, and a new study indicates that it's not just those with severe cases who deal with long-term symptoms of the virus — many people with mild or asymptomatic cases can also become "long-haulers.
"
In one of the first large studies focused on mild COVID-19 cases in people who did not require hospitalization, researchers looked at the medical records of 1,407 people in California who had tested positive for COVID-19 and experienced mild symptoms or were asymptomatic when they were initially infected.
Of that group, 382 people, or 27%, were struggling with COVID-19 symptoms like shortness of breath, nausea, coughing and joint pain more than 60 days after testing positive.
And a third of those with long-term symptoms said that they did not have any symptoms when they were first diagnosed with COVID-19, or in the 10 days after their positive test.
Women "were more likely to become long-haulers," the researchers said, and these long-term symptoms were found in people of any age group, with most around age 50.
There were also 34 children in the study, and 11 had long-term symptoms.
The study, from researchers at the University of California, Irvine, is currently on MedRxiv, a pre-print site for medical studies that are undergoing peer review.

Currently, not much is known about why some people suffer from long-term COVID-19 symptoms while others do not.
In February, the National Institutes of Health announced that they would begin a new initiative to study "long COVID" and better understand the reasons for the ongoing symptoms.
The researchers from UC Irvine also noted the lack of research on "long-haulers" in their study.
"Long-haulers represent a very significant public health concern, and there are no guidelines to address their diagnosis and management," they wrote.
"Additional studies are urgently needed that focus on the physical, mental, and emotional impact of long-term COVID-19 survivors who become long-haulers."
When you think about COVID-19 symptoms, cough, fever or shortness of breath might come to mind.
However, many COVID-19 patients suffer from gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in addition to (or instead of) respiratory symptoms.
“Early on, the CDC list of COVID-19 symptoms did not include gastrointestinal symptoms,” said Dr. Jordan Shapiro, assistant professor of medicine – gastroenterology at Baylor.
“It became clear after the first few months that there is a subset of COVID-19 patients with non-respiratory symptoms.
We now know that subset is about one-third of COVID-19 patients.”
Gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19 can include loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting and abdominal pain.
However, not all patients with COVID-19 and GI symptoms have symptoms at initial presentation, according to Shapiro.
Some patients will develop symptoms several days into or even after the initial infection has cleared.
Shapiro has seen patients at the Baylor Medicine Post COVID Care Clinic who have recovered from COVID-19, but experience ongoing loss of appetite, nausea, acid reflux, diarrhea, bloating and abdominal distension.
“Some people don’t immediately realize that their GI symptoms coincided with their COVID-19 infection, and they may not think the symptoms are related to COVID-19 because they’re not respiratory in nature,” Shapiro said.
Post-infectious GI issues are common after other non-COVID-19 viral or bacterial infections, and some patients experience post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome or gastroparesis.
Those symptoms tend to have good long-term prognoses, with the majority improving over weeks, months or less commonly, years.
Researchers believe COVID-19 causes GI symptoms, in part, because the ACE2 receptor used by the SARS-CoV-2 virus to infect cells, is found throughout the GI tract.
It remains unclear if the duration of post-COVID GI symptoms will mirror that of other post-infectious GI conditions or not.
Shapiro says mild GI symptoms can usually be treated with over-the-counter medication.
But he encourages any patients experiencing persistent GI symptoms to see a gastroenterologist, even if they are unsure if the symptoms are related to a COVID-19 infection.
“We can test for other contributing factors to the GI symptoms with a variety of tests from blood and stool samples to breath tests to radiology testing and occasionally endoscopy,” he said.
“If everything comes back normal, we have a variety of treatments for the symptoms.
There’s no reason to suffer in silence.”

New COVID-19 strain Arcturus may cause pink eye, LA County health officials say
Los Angeles County health officials noted that the new Arcturus strain of COVID-19 may be tied to an unusual symptom - pink eye.

Los Angeles County health officials noted that the new Arcturus strain of COVID-19 may be tied to an unusual symptom - pink eye.
LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Los Angeles County public health officials are warning residents that a new strain of COVID-19 may be tied to pink eye.
Health experts have not conclusively linked pink eye, also known as conjunctivitis, to the new strain.
However, local officials are asking the public "take the same sensible COVID precautions" to avoid infection.
L.A. County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said last week the link between the strain Arcturus, or XBB.1.16, and pink eye is only from "observational data," and it remains too early to determine if the emergence of the new strain actually is linked to higher rates of conjunctivitis.
"However, residents should be aware that itchy, watery or red eyes may be a sign of a COVID-19 infection and these symptoms should not be simply dismissed as a result of pollen or seasonal allergies, especially if someone more vulnerable to severe illness could be exposed," according to the health department.
Current vaccines and therapeutics are highly likely to remain protective and able to ward off severe illness caused by the new strain, according to the health department.
The health department says pink eye can be painful, itchy and highly contagious.
If left untreated, it can cause damage to the cornea.
Historically, conjunctivitis was reported in 1-3% of COVID-19 cases.
Three confirmed cases of the new strain were reported in L.A. County last week.
Modeling by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that Arcturus accounts for 8% of COVID cases in California and 10% nationally.
City News Service contributed to this report.
Breathlessness or difficulty breathing is counted to be a serious COVID-19 symptom, and chances are, for patients who had some level of lung involvement during their COVID-19 infection (a common manifestation of the Delta variant), it can take a while for the respiratory organ to fully heal, and thus, symptoms like breathlessness, chest pain, shortness of breath could continue for a while.
Persistent coughing, a change in the voice could also be experienced if you had heavy inflammation in the upper respiratory tract.
While patients should focus on restoring lung function and not overstress themselves, one must also do breathing exercises and do slow-paced activities for a while, if the symptoms continue to strike.
Some might also require oxygen support for a while to recover well.
Soothing drinks and concoctions also certainly help.
A Valley teen is still battling the symptoms of COVID-19 more than a year after contracting the virus.
Lydia Pastore, a 16-year-old junior at Red Mountain High School became incredibly sick in February 2020.
For the past year, she has experienced intense fatigue, body aches, and a slew of other symptoms ranging from burning eyes and face to hand tremors.
"That was the worst sickness that I had ever endured in my life," said Lydia.
"It's just been constant muscle aches and fatigue where I just can’t snap out of it.
Walking to the end of my driveway, it would exhaust me to the point of having to recover for two days.
All year long, Lydia was plagued by chronic fatigue, sleeping on average 15 hours a day.
After multiple doctor's visits, she began a journal as therapy for her hand tremors that turned into a tracking method for her own symptoms.
"I made a monthly symptom tracker, just because there were so many symptoms to keep track of," said Lydia.
"I wish that at the beginning of my infection I had had a resource like that because every specialist I had visited asked me, 'What has changed?
What is new?
What are the symptoms you're experiencing?'
And it was always frustrating trying to remember all that.
"
Lydia decided to turn her ailments into a chance to connect with other teens who are battling the long-term effects of COVID-19.
She created the website chronicconnections.org, where teens can share their personal journey with COVID-19, and request a symptom-tracking journal that Lydia sends out free to anyone in America.
"I would hope that it would be a place for teens to connect with others who are going through the same thing as them.
To find comfort in similarity," said Lydia, who has already received four letters from teens about their struggles.
"I’m just so happy already with these four stories already that I’ve had so far and I’ve given these journals to, but I just feel there are so many more teens out there.
"
What is "Long COVID?"
Lydia said she has seen eight different health specialists find out why she is still experiencing COVID-19 symptoms months after her illness.
Her tests for Valley fever came back negative.
Although she was never tested for COVID-19, her doctors believe that Lydia has "Long COVID," when a person experiences COVID-19 symptoms long after contracting the virus.
"This post-viral syndrome occurs where you’re done with the initial infection but for some unknown reason, we continue to have some of the symptoms you had before for a length of time that doesn’t really make sense scientifically," said Dr. Gary Kirkilas, spokesperson for American Academy of Pediatrics.
To doctors, Lydia is considered a "long hauler."
Dr. Kirkilas said once the virus clears in long haulers, there is a residual effect from COVID-19 that could be caused by remaining low amounts of the virus that are undetectable by COVID-19 tests, but still require a response from the body's immune system.
Another reason could be that the initial virus caused internal organ damage that is still not healed.
On Tuesday, The National Institute of Health (NIH) announced a new initiative to study "Long COVID" to "identify the causes and ultimately the means of prevention and treatment of individuals who have been sickened by COVID-19, but don’t recover fully over a period of a few weeks."
According to the NIH, symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, “brain fog,” sleep disorders, fevers, gastrointestinal symptoms, anxiety, and depression.
"The thing that separates them is this brain issue, this brain issue of this fog," said Dr. Frank LoVecchio, ER Physician at Valleywise Hospital.
"In the hospital, we call it encephalitis (or inflammation of the brain).
They can’t concentrate as well.
They tend to be more forgetful.
"
In December, the U.S. Congress provided $1.15 billion in funds to the NIH to study the long-term effects of COVID-19.
Share on Pinterest A new survey suggests that vaccination may improve symptoms of long COVID.
Jasmin Merdan/Getty Images
Symptoms of long COVID include fatigue, brain fog, muscle pain, shortness of breath, and loss of taste and smell.
In the largest survey to date of vaccinated people with long COVID, 57% of respondents reported an overall improvement in their symptoms following vaccination, while 19% reported an overall deterioration.
Respondents who received the Moderna vaccine were more likely to report improvements and potentially less likely to report deterioration, compared with those who received other vaccines.
Possible explanations for improvements after vaccination include clearing the residual virus and restoring a healthy balance to the immune system.

The Office for National Statistics in the United Kingdom estimates that 13.7% of people who test positive for COVID-19 still experience symptoms 4 months later.
The condition, which resembles other types of post-viral syndrome, is known as long COVID.
Common symptoms include:
fatigue
shortness of breath
difficulty concentrating, or brain fog
mood changes
muscle pain
loss of taste and smell, or anosmia
insomnia
heart palpitations
There is no proven treatment for long COVID, but anecdotal reports have begun to emerge of people recovering after COVID-19 vaccination.
At the same time, some people with the condition have been reluctant to get vaccinated because of concerns that it will make their symptoms worse.

A small study, which has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, found that the AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines were associated with overall improvements in symptoms.
There was no evidence of declines in quality of life or mental well-being.
Researchers in the United Kingdom have now conducted the largest survey to date of changes in 14 long COVID symptoms following vaccination.
The study has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.
There were 900 respondents, most of whom had received the AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, or Moderna vaccines.
More than 70% reported they experienced symptoms for 9 months or more.
Combining the results across all the symptoms, 56.7% of respondents experienced an improvement, 18.7% experienced a deterioration, and 24.6% remained unchanged.
Respondents who received the Moderna vaccine, which is an mRNA vaccine, were most likely to report improvements and least likely to report a deterioration of their symptoms.
Scientists at the University of Exeter and the University of Kent in the United Kingdom collaborated with the patient advocacy group LongCovidSOS on the survey.
In their unpublished report, the scientists write:
“The results of this survey should reassure people with long COVID that their chance of experiencing an overall worsening of their symptoms after vaccination is small.
More than half saw at least some improvement to their symptom status.”
The authors call for clinical trials to investigate further the possible benefits of vaccination for people with long COVID.
The Ministry of Health & Wellness wishes to remind members of the public that if they develop mild flu-like symptoms they are to remain at home and monitor themselves, while observing the infection prevention and control measures.
If symptoms worsen or persist beyond three days, then medical advice should be sought from a private doctor, a health centre or the parish health department.
Persons may be advised to do a COVID-19 test, which can be done privately or in the public health system by referral.
A list of public health testing sites is available on the Ministry of Health & Wellness’ website.
Persons with severe symptoms should seek immediate medical attention.
All persons are encouraged to frequently wash their hands, wear a mask, get vaccinated, take a booster, observe physical distance, avoid crowded spaces, stay hydrated, exercise regularly, and eat healthy.

Doctors are beginning to notice Covid-19 cases that look more like a very bad cold, especially in areas of the country where the highly contagious delta variant is quickly spreading.
While shortness of breath and other lung issues remain among the most worrisome Covid-19 symptoms, it appears upper respiratory complaints — marked by congestion, a runny nose and headache — may be increasing.
Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak
"We've seen a number of folks with cold-like symptoms," said Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr., an internist at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock.
The potential shift in symptoms is not to say that the illness should be brushed off as just a cold.
Respiratory droplets emitted from coughs and sneezes can infect other, more vulnerable, people.
And cases that start off mild can worsen and become more serious.
"Covid can present in different ways," said Dr. Russell Vinik, chief medical operations officer at the University of Utah Health in Salt Lake City.
"If you think you have a cold, you're infectious, and whether that's Covid or a cold, you should consider getting a test.
"
Vinik has also seen more people coming in with cold-like symptoms.
And previously typical Covid-19 symptoms such as loss of taste and smell are not as commonly reported anymore, he said.
Both Hopkins and Vinik said their patients tend to be unvaccinated and skew younger than earlier in the pandemic.
It is not clear why common cold symptoms are increasingly reported in Covid-19 cases, though some experts suspect it could be due to the delta variant, which now accounts for about 20 percent of new cases in the U.S. Arkansas and Utah, where Hopkins and Vinik are respectively based, have some of the highest rates of delta cases in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Indeed, in the United Kingdom, where delta is implicated in more than 95 percent of new cases, researchers say the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are now that of a bad cold: headache, sore throat, runny nose and fever.
"What we've been seeing in the last month is very much a change in the symptoms," said Tim Spector, a professor of epidemiology at King's College London.
Spector heads a project called the ZOE Covid Study, an app where users report symptoms, vaccination status and other demographic information daily.
More than 4 million people in the U.K. have signed on, as well as about 300,000 people in the U.S.
"We get a picture of where things are happening in real time," Spector said.
"We also get to hear about the commonest symptoms in different times of year and in different locations.
"
Spector's research finds that earlier symptoms, such as shortness of breath, persistent cough and loss of smell, "have dropped out of the top five" of the most common Covid-19 symptoms.
The CDC has long included classic "common cold" symptoms of congestion and a runny nose on its list potential Covid-19 symptoms.
A spokesperson told NBC News the agency has no immediate plan to change symptom guidance.
Still, physicians in the U.S. are paying attention to what's happening in the U.K., which is "two to three months ahead of us," Vinik said.
Dr. Andy Dunn, a family physician and chief of staff at Wyoming Medical Center in Casper, agreed, adding that what is happening now in the U.K. could predict Covid-19 cases later this summer and into fall.
It's also possible the shift in Covid-19 symptoms has nothing to with the delta variant.
Now that most older adults have received the Covid-19 vaccine, new cases are skewing toward younger, mostly unvaccinated, adults.
Younger people have generally been spared the worst of Covid-19.
"Now that we have vaccinated all of those older people, you take their symptoms out of the mix," said Alasdair Munro, a senior clinical research fellow in pediatric infectious diseases at the National Institute for Health Research in the U.K.
"People who would get those milder symptoms normally are now a much bigger proportion of everyone who gets infected," Munro said.
Dunn estimates that three-quarters of his Covid-19 patients now are under age 50.
He is also seeing an uptick in congestion associated with the virus.
Most of Dunn's sickest Covid-19 patients are unvaccinated.
Wyoming is one of the states with the lowest vaccination rates in the country; just over 30 percent of residents are fully vaccinated.
Dunn said the combination of the low vaccination rate and societal unmasking has led to "huge breeding grounds for more variants to evolve and to really grab ahold of a community that could have wiped this out with vaccines.
"
Don't think you're immune to Covid just because you're vaccinated.
But even those who have been vaccinated are not entirely immune to Covid-19.
While highly effective, the vaccines do not prevent 100 percent of infections.
Breakthrough cases — infections in people who are fully vaccinated — can occur.
"If you've been vaccinated and you have symptoms, don't discount them.
You could still get Covid," Vinik, of the University of Utah Health, said.
"Don't think you're immune to Covid just because you're vaccinated," he warned.
That means even among the vaccinated crowd, a stuffed-up nose, sore throat, slight fever or fatigue may warrant a Covid-19 test.
"Is it just a cold?
Or is it Covid?
We're not doing enough testing to have a good idea of how much Covid is circulating in our communities," Hopkins, of the University of Arkansas Medical Center, said.
Spector, of the U.K.'s ZOE project, had more pointed advice.
"If you're not sure it's a cold, I would assume it could be Covid," he said.

More than one-third of kids who have COVID-19 are asymptomatic, according to a University of Alberta study that suggests youngsters diagnosed with the disease may represent just a fraction of those infected.
“The concern from a public health perspective is that there is probably a lot of COVID-19 circulating in the community that people don't even realize,” said Finlay McAlister, a professor of medicine in the Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry.
“When we see reports of 1,200 new cases per day in Alberta, that’s likely just the tip of the iceberg—there are likely many people who don't know they have the disease and are potentially spreading it,” he said.
For the study, McAlister’s team analyzed results for 2,463 children who were tested during the first wave of the pandemic—March to September—for COVID-19 infection.
All told, 1,987 children had a positive test result for COVID-19 and 476 had a negative result.
Of children who tested positive, 714—35.9 per cent—reported being asymptomatic.
“It speaks to the school safety programs,” he said.
“We can do all the COVID-19 questionnaires we want, but if one-third of the kids are asymptomatic, the answer is going to be no to all the questions—yet they’re still infected.”
Because of the asymptomatic nature of the disease in up to one-third of children, McAlister said the province was right to close schools for a longer period over Christmas.
“As far as we know, kids are less likely to spread disease than adults, but the risk is not zero,” he said.
“Presumably asymptomatic spreaders are less contagious than the person sitting nearby who is sneezing all over you, but we don't know that for sure.”
The researchers also found that although cough, runny nose and sore throat were three of the most common symptoms among children with COVID-19 infection—showing up in 25, 19 and 16 per cent of cases respectively—they were actually slightly more common among those with negative COVID-19 test results, and therefore not predictive of a positive test.
“Of course, kids are at risk of contracting many different viruses, so the COVID-specific symptoms are actually more things like loss of taste and smell, headache, fever, and nausea and vomiting, not runny nose, a cough and sore throat,” he said.
McAlister noted that his group has a similar paper coming out that shows sore throats and runny noses aren’t reliable signs of COVID-19 in adults either, although the vast majority of adults (84 per cent) do show symptoms.
“Sore throat and runny nose means you've got some kind of upper respiratory tract infection, but fever, headache, and loss of taste or smell are the big ones for indicating that one may have COVID-19 rather than another viral upper respiratory tract infection,” he said, adding nausea and vomiting wasn’t as prominent in adults.
McAlister added that if people have any symptoms at all, they should stay home and get tested, while even those who feel well should still be doing everything they can to stay safe—wearing a protective mask, frequent handwashing, keeping distance, and avoiding meeting indoors.
“Some people with COVID feel well and don’t realize they have it
so they socialize with friends and unintentionally spread the virus, and I think that's the big issue,” he said.

FRIDAY, July 21, 2023 (HealthDay News) --
Close to one-fifth of kids with COVID-19 may still have lingering symptoms months after their initial infection, new research finds.
The review, of 31 international studies, found that over 16% of children and teenagers with COVID had problems such as sore throat, persistent fevers, fatigue and muscle weakness at least three months later.
Experts said the findings add to a still-evolving picture of how COVID affects kids in the longer term.
What is clear, they said, is that children can develop long COVID, and it is far from a rare occurrence.
"This is not a trivial infection," said senior researcher Zulfiqar Bhutta, co-director of the Centre for Global Child Health at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.
"We need to take it seriously.
"
He and his colleagues report the findings in the July 21 issue of Pediatrics.
More than three years after the start of the pandemic, long COVID remains something of a mystery -- and its effects on kids are no exception.
But studies are ongoing, said Dr. Melissa Stockwell, division chief of child and adolescent health at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City.
Stockwell and colleagues at Columbia are part of a large national study called RECOVER, funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, which is aimed at better understanding the long-term effects of COVID in adults and children.
Stockwell said that while it's hard to say exactly what percentage of kids develop long COVID, the evidence suggests it's between 10% and 20%.
So the new findings align with that, she said.
"It's really worrisome, because that's a very large number of kids," Stockwell said.
Yet, she noted, "I don't think most people even know that kids get long COVID.
"
Researchers are still trying to understand the underlying biology of long COVID -- whether symptoms are driven by persistent virus in the body, an immune system on overdrive, or a combination of reasons.
And it's unclear why some children, and not others, are affected.
There does seem to be a correlation between COVID severity and the risk of long-term symptoms, according to Stockwell: Kids who are more severely ill with the infection are at greater risk.
But, she said, children with mild infections, or even no symptoms at all, can and do develop long COVID.
For the current review, Bhutta's team analyzed 31 studies published between December 2019 and December 2022, involving more than 15,000 children and teenagers with confirmed COVID infections.
Some studies focused on kids who were ill enough to be hospitalized, but most included those who were sick at home.
Overall, just over 16% of kids had symptoms three months or more after their COVID diagnosis -- including problems that had persisted since the infection or newly arose in the weeks to months afterward.
The most common symptoms, Bhutta's team found, were persistent sore throat and fevers, fatigue, sleep problems and muscle weakness.
But kids -- like adults with long COVID -- also had an array of other issues, including headaches, shortness of breath and gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea and abdominal pain.
At this point, Stockwell said, management of long COVID is aimed at easing the particular symptoms a child has.
For those kids, and their parents, a major question is, how long will this last?
Researchers are still studying the typical course of long COVID.
But based on what's known, Bhutta said, at least a portion of kids do get better six to 12 months out.
As for what parents can do to protect their kids, it's not yet clear whether COVID vaccination
curbs the risk of long COVID should a child become infected.
"But," Stockwell said, "we do know that vaccination lowers the risk of severe COVID.
"
That alone is good reason to have your kids vaccinated and up to date on their boosters, Bhutta and Stockwell said.
Bhutta also pointed to another major knowledge gap: the lack of studies from middle- and low-income countries.
In those countries, with limited access to vaccines and treatments, the prevalence of long COVID among children could actually be higher, Bhutta said.

As COVID's incubation period changes, what does that mean for isolation time and how long you are contagious?
During a Facebook Live last month, Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady reported that recent studies have shown the incubation period for COVID has dropped to three days with recent variants.
"So if you go back to like alpha variant, beta, delta - early on, it was about a five-day incubation period on average.
So, if you were exposed to COVID, on average we were seeing people take about five days for someone to end up testing positive - and remember that went from four to five, out to 10, out to 14," she said.
"The reason ... we only use 10 days now, it is because that timing has shortened.
And so, more recently with BA.4, BA.5, that's all the way down to about three days now.
So on average, people are testing positive about three days after, but you can have someone positive up to 10 days.
"
Arwady said most elements of COVID are moving faster with the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.
"That is excellent news from a control perspective and because one of the biggest challenges of COVID is that... when the incubation period is long, you can get infected with COVID, potentially have a long time before you have significant symptoms and it'll be spreading it," she said.
"So it's good news to see that incubation period getting shorter.
"
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, someone with COVID-19 is "considered infectious starting two days before they develop symptoms, or two days before the date of their positive test if they do not have symptoms.
"
Regardless of symptoms, those who test positive are advised to take specific precautions for at least 10 days, though five days is the new isolation minimum, per the CDC.
But does that mean you aren't contagious after five days?
The answer depends.
People are likely the most infectious in the first five days after contracting the virus, health officials state, hence why isolation is recommended.
Feeling out of the loop?
We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know.
Sign up for the weekly Chicago Catch-Up newsletter here.
As a precaution, those who test positive are encouraged to wear a well-fitting face mask through day 10, even though the risk has gone down at that point.
Once day 10 rolls around, the risk drops significantly, including for those who have lingering symptoms, Arwady previously stated.
"If you're mostly feeling well, especially if what is still kind of lingering is a cough or a little bit of cough tends to be the last thing to go away after any virus, it is unlikely that you are still spreading disease," the doctor said.
If after five days you are fever-free for 24 hours without the use of medication, and your symptoms are improving, or you never had symptoms, you may end isolation.
But if you're still getting a positive test after six to 10 days, Arwady said you could still be contagious.
"Generally if their symptoms have resolved, they are very unlikely to still be spreading a lot of COVID.
But if you still have a positive rapid test, make sure you are wearing a mask, consider isolating," Arwady said last month.
She clarified that the positive test applies more so to rapid results, as opposed to PCR.
PCR COVID tests can stay positive for a "very long time" after recovering from the virus because they pick up on any dead infection.
Explaining most Americans have some level of immunity, the CDC issued major changes to its COVID guidelines in August, altering the recommendations for quarantine, social distancing and even testing.
Here's a breakdown of what we know:
When do you need to isolate?
According to the CDC, regardless of vaccination status, you should isolate from others when you have COVID-19.
You should also isolate if you are sick or suspect that you have COVID-19 but are waiting on test results.
It's important to note that if you were exposed to COVID-19, the Food and Drug Administration now recommends you take three home tests instead of two to make sure you’re not infected.
The new guidance applies to people without symptoms who think they may have been exposed.
Previously, the FDA had advised taking two rapid antigen tests over two or three days to rule out infection.
But the agency says new studies suggest that protocol can miss too many infections, and could result in people spreading the coronavirus to others, especially if they don't develop symptoms.
How long should you isolate?
If you test positive for COVID-19, the guidance states that you should stay home for at least five days and isolate from others in your home.
You are likely most infectious during these first five days.
When you end isolation, you should still avoid being around people who are most at-risk until at least day 11.
After you have ended isolation, you'll also need to wear a mask through day 10, per the guidelines.
The CDC also notes, however, that if you have access to antigen tests, "you should consider using them.
"
"With two sequential negative tests 48 hours apart, you may remove your mask sooner than day 10," the guidance states, adding that if your antigen test results are positive, "you may still be infectious.
"
Those who continue to test positive should continue masking.
"You should continue wearing a mask and wait at least 48 hours before taking another test," the CDC recommends.
"Continue taking antigen tests at least 48 hours apart until you have two sequential negative results.
This may mean you need to continue wearing a mask and testing beyond day 10.
"
If your symptoms worsen or return after you end isolation, you'll need to restart your isolation at day 0, per the guidelines.
How do you calculate isolation time?
The CDC states that isolation for those who have COVID is counted in days, but it depends on if you have symptoms.
If you have no symptoms:
Day 0 is the day you were tested (not the day you received your positive test result)
Day 1 is the first full day following the day you were tested
If you develop symptoms within 10 days of when you were tested, the clock restarts at day 0 on the day of symptom onset
If you have symptoms:
Day 0 of isolation is the day of symptom onset, regardless of when you tested positive
Day 1 is the first full day after the day your symptoms started
What does isolation include?
Wear a high-quality mask if you must be around others at home and in public.
Do not go places where you are unable to wear a mask.
Do not travel.
Stay home and separate from others as much as possible.
Use a separate bathroom, if possible.
Take steps to improve ventilation at home, if possible.
Don’t share personal household items, like cups, towels, and utensils.
Monitor your symptoms.
If you have an emergency warning sign (like trouble breathing), seek emergency medical care immediately.
What do you need to do to end isolation?
If you had no symptoms, you can end isolation after day 5, according to the CDC.
If you had symptoms, however, you can only end isolation after day 5 if:
You are fever-free for 24 hours (without the use of fever-reducing medication)
Your symptoms are improving
If you still have a fever or your other symptoms have not improved, continue to isolate until they improve, the guidelines state.
How severe your symptoms are can also play a role.
If you had moderate illness - such as shortness of breath or difficulty breathing - or severe illness, including hospitalization due to COVID-19, or if you have a weakened immune system, you need to isolate through day 10.
If you had severe illness or have a weakened immune system, you'll want to consult your doctor before ending isolation as you may need a viral test to do so.
Do you need to quarantine?
The CDC previously said that if people who are not up to date on their COVID-19 vaccinations come into close contact with a person who tests positive, they should stay home for at least five days.
Now the agency says quarantining at home is not necessary, but it urges those people to wear a high-quality mask for 10 days and get tested after five.
Covid symptoms: Professor says range should be expanded
Covid has killed more than 140,000 people in the UK since the start of the pandemic, and the government is still urging people to get tested if they develop any of the key symptoms of coronavirus.
You could also be at risk of the infection if you develop 'Covid tongue', it's now been revealed.
The number of new Covid cases has started to fall since the start of 2021.
On December 29, the number of daily coronavirus cases in the UK peaked at 81,567.
The latest figures, as of March 8, revealed that 6,833 people tested positive for coronavirus.
Health officials have still urged the public to remain vigilant for symptoms, and to get tested if they develop any of the three key signs of infection.

Covid new strain symptoms: What does Covid tongue look like?
Mouth signs of coronavirus
Scientists have warned of a potential new coronavirus symptom, which has been dubbed Covid tongue.
More and more people have started to report changes to their tongue after testing positive for the virus, according to the Zoe Covid Symptom Study app.
It's not entirely clear what specifically causes Covid tongue, or any other changes to the mouth.
As many as a quarter of all hospitalised patients may have developed slight changes to their tongue.

What does Covid tongue look like?
Your tongue may start to appear white and patchy, the scientists wrote.
Patients have also reported an unusually dry mouth and subsequent fungal infection.
Fungal infections can cause white blotches to develop on the tongue, but previous patients' symptoms were unsuccessfully treated with antifungal drugs.
Covid tongue could also be accompanied by a change to the tongue's sensation, as well as muscle pain while chewing and persistent ulcers.

"For a while we’ve been noticing an increasing number of people reporting that their tongue doesn’t look normal, particularly that it is white and patchy," the researchers wrote.
"Right now we don’t know what causes COVID tongue or other changes to the mouth such as ulcers or swelling.
"It might be a direct effect of viral infection, or it could be a more general immune-related response to being ill.
"We also don’t know whether changes to the mouth or tongue can be the only symptom of COVID-19, or whether they tend to come earlier or later in the illness.

The Covid-19 outbreak has brought untold miseries to many businesses, but the healthtech landscape has grown through it, devising ingenious mechanisms and technologies to fight the public health crisis.
According to DataLabs by Inc42+’s ‘India’s Healthtech Landscape In A Post-Covid-19 World Report 2020’, the size of the healthtech market in India is likely to touch $21 billion by 2025.
While the lockdowns restricted the availability of raw materials, broke the supply chain, and made labour scarce, a number of healthtech startups augmented or revamped their existing resources to fight Covid-19.

Mudit Dandwate and Gaurav Parchani met while working at Altair Engineering, where they designed race car simulators.
After close to two years, they realised they were making high adrenaline but low-impact innovations.
The IIT graduates decided to set up Turtle Shell Technologies in 2015 and move into the health care space.
It launched a health monitoring device in July 2019, Dozee, that is kept under a mattress to capture the body’s micro vibrations.
“We benchmarked the product against other medical equipment to prove we are more than 98.4 percent accurate, while being contactless,” says Dandwate.
The company was focussing on selling to high-risk patients and senior citizens, but the pandemic opened new business avenues.
Dozee already covered most of the health parameters needed for monitoring Covid-19.
“But,” says Dandwate, “there were factors such as oxygen levels and blood pressure that were missing.”
These parameters were added, and Dozee was integrated with third-party devices.
Now the team is working on including temperature monitoring.
The company started getting requests from a number of hospitals.
“Dozee was a perfect fit for monitoring patients in hospitals and homes.
Nurses don’t need to check on patients for things like vitals.
Through Dozee, we are updating those every 30 seconds,” says Dandwate.
The data is collected in real-time, and can be monitored from a control room, minimising interactions between health care workers and patients.
Changes in readings send alerts immediately to doctors or family members.
“These alerts have led to timely transfers of patients to ICUs and helped in saving lives,” he adds.
The device has two variants: The basic one that costs ₹7,999, and another with an oximeter that costs ₹9,999.
Its revamped version was launched in mid-May and has seen close to 2,000 installations in 12 hospitals.
“Earlier, we sold via aggregators, but are now selling via Amazon and our website,” says Dandwate.
Production has been ramped up from 500 devices a month to 2,000-2,500.“Pre-Covid, we were earning close to ₹17 lakh per month, now it is ₹50 lakh,” he says.
“While we were backed by a number of grants, including BIRAC and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, we have raised an additional ₹3 crore from angel investors during the pandemic.”
Timing of dyspnea may be one of the most important hallmarks of COVID-19 coronavirus infection, especially for clinicians seeing patients in an ambulatory setting, experts argued.
In COVID-19, shortness of breath typically sets in between the 4th and 8th day of illness, although it can be as much as 10 days after the onset of symptoms, wrote Pieter Cohen, MD, of Cambridge Health Alliance and Harvard Medical School in Boston, and colleagues in a preprint in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings.
In March 2020, the authors set up an ambulatory care clinic in Massachusetts, specifically to deal with patients who had symptoms of the illness, and gain an understanding of its typical presentation, the authors wrote.
But COVID-19 may be difficult to distinguish due to its constellation of symptoms, and Cohen told MedPage Today that for clinicians seeing patients in ambulatory settings, they could see anything from a mild runny nose to very dramatic, flu-like symptoms like myalgia.
"Where we need to focus attention is that, in general, shortness of breath takes time to develop.
As soon as someone starts reporting 'I had this illness ...
and now I have new shortness of breath,' start watching their symptoms over the next 72 hours.
"
Cohen said clinicians should especially be looking for when the shortness of breath began, and if it's worsening as the days progress.
But because most patients do not have a high-quality oximeter at home, a majority of this information can be taken through a patient's history.
Some examples of questions may be "is there anything you can't do today that you could do yesterday" or even "what are you able to do at home," Cohen noted.
"Sometimes patients get out of breath speaking to us on the phone, and you can hear it that way," he said.
However, the authors noted that dyspnea related to COVID-19 presents differently from dyspnea associated with other illnesses.
In post-viral pneumonia different from COVID-19, for example, increasing fever and productive cough may be symptoms of worsening illness, whereas in COVID-19, worsening dyspnea may be without productive cough.
Likewise, dyspnea would improve gradually over the course of an uncomplicated influenza infection, not get worse.
Then there are patients who think they have COVID-19, which the authors described as anxiety plus viral-type symptoms.
But they noted key markers to distinguish patients with anxiety-related dyspnea with shortness of breath related to COVID-19.
"With anxiety, onset is often immediately after the first symptoms of infection while with SARS-CoV-2 [the virus that causes COVID-19] dyspnea occurs several days after the initial symptoms begin," the authors wrote.
"Patients with COVID-related anxiety often describe the sensation of not being able to get enough air into their lungs, while with SARS-CoV-2 infection dyspnea is consistently worse with exertion.
"
While the researchers noted that dizziness occurs with both conditions, similar to dyspnea, it is more present when an anxious patient is at rest, and more present with exertion when a patient has COVID-19.
The authors added that a pulse oximeter to show normal oxygen saturation can help confirm anxiety-related shortness of breath.
In fact, they noted, onset of dyspnea several days after non-specific viral symptoms, plus "precipitous drops in oxygen saturation especially with exertion" can help distinguish COVID-19 from other viral conditions.
Disclosures Cohen disclosed compensation from UptoDate.

Fever, cough and shortness of breath are the classic symptoms of COVID-19, but there may be gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea and diarrhea, that are getting missed, according to a new Stanford Medicine study.
Researchers found that, in addition to upper respiratory symptoms, a significant number of those sick with the new virus also suffered from loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
The study, one of the earliest on U.S. patients with the coronavirus, was published online April 10 in Gastroenterology.
Gastroenterology fellows George Cholankeril, MD, and Alexander Podboy, MD, share lead authorship.
Aijaz Ahmed, MD, professor of gastroenterology and hepatology, is the senior author.
“COVID-19 is probably not just respiratory symptoms like a cough,” Podboy said.
“A third of the patients we studied had gastrointestinal symptoms.
It’s possible we may be missing a significant portion of patients sick with the coronavirus due to our current testing strategies focusing on respiratory symptoms alone.”
Unique situation
As the coronavirus pandemic hit the San Francisco Bay Area in early March, hospitals began canceling elective surgeries and postponing nonemergency patient visits to make room for a surge of coronavirus patients.
With their clinics closed and other projects on hold, a group of gastroenterology fellows had time to work together on a project, Podboy said.
“George recognized early on that since Stanford was among the first hospitals to get COVID-19 patients in the U.S., that any type of early experience would be important,” he said.
“We were in a unique position to look into this subject of gastrointestinal symptoms among coronavirus patients at Stanford.”
The researchers were aware of a growing body of research out of China and Singapore that showed a prevalence of GI symptoms in COVID-19 patients, but could find no data on the topic from patients in the United States.
They decided to conduct their own study by examining the charts of the earliest group of patients treated for the virus at Stanford Health Care.
Study results
Researchers analyzed data collected from 116 patients who tested positive for the coronavirus at Stanford Health Care from March 4-24.
The majority were treated and released from a hospital emergency room or a clinic.
A total of 33 were hospitalized, eight of those in an intensive care unit.
The median age of the patients was 50, and 53% of them were men.
Only one death was reported within the group.
"But the one big thing is the running volume, the aerobic capacity base, which I am going to try and build up in the next two weeks, so that means lot of running, or a lot of cardio work, cycling or swimming."
Remember how Ted Nugent tested positive for COVID-19 last month?
Nugent, one of the leading skeptics of the pandemic and the recovery from said pandemic, revealed in a message to fans that he had COVID for 10 days.
And now, it's come out that seven days before he recorded that message, Nugent performed at a public maskless event.
On April 19th, 2021, Nugent announced in a video "Everybody told me that I should not announce this.
I have had flu symptoms for the last ten days.
I thought I was dying.
Just a clusterfuck.
"I was tested positive today.
I got the Chinese shit.
I've got a stuffed up head, body aches.
My God, what a pain in the ass.
I literally could hardly crawl out of bed the last few days…
So I was officially tested positive for COVID-19 today.
"
Nugent went on to say that he's never been so sick in his entire life, and will get through this with willpower.
"I've been around a long time — 72.4 years, to be exact — and it's been quite an adventure…
But I have never been so sick in all my life… I could barely crawl out of bed.
And I'm not looking for sympathy; I'm just trying to share a medical emergency during a global medical emergency, and what the Nugent tribe, what this guitar player is doing to counterpunch a COVID-19 positive test this afternoon.
And it's gonna be willpower.
"
Okay, now that we're all caught up, a report in his local paper, the Naples Daily News reveals that three days into his flu-like symptoms, Nugent put fellow Naples residents at risk by visiting and performing at a maskless event at Oakes Seed to Table.
The paper specifically notes video shows that Nugent and his wife were not wearing masks at the event.
Nugent was his regular charming self at the event, talking with a local official and performing some music.
Naples Daily News offered this transcription of what was said.
"First, God bless America.
Let me tell you, first of all, Southwest Florida, one of the safest places to live in the entire state with the lowest crime rate.
Why is that?
Because all law enforcement and the greatest citizens of this county stick together and we put bad people in jail.
And that's where they belong."
Nugent continued, saying how places like Minnesota and Detroit — the "'blue smudges," referring to places that lean more for Democrats — are "releasing the most demonic creatures into our neighborhoods."
He asked Marceno what citizens can do about it.
The market made headlines when it refused to adhere to local mask mandates.
A county commission meeting eventually voted to unanimously halt any enforcement against the store.
No word on if any other people at the event were infected.
New research published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) found that one-third of children who tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 had no symptoms, but in those that did, loss of taste/smell, headache, fever and nausea/vomiting were most strongly associated with positive cases.
Other flu-like symptoms — including cough, runny nose and sore throat — were the most prominent symptoms in positive cases, but the study suggests they couldn't be used to accurately predict which cases were positive because they were also most prominent in cases that tested negative.
The study, published Monday, was by researchers at the University of Alberta who analyzed 2,463 test results from children in the province between April 13 to Sept. 30.
They compared symptoms of those who tested positive (1,987) with those who tested negative (476).
Eight per cent of kids with positive COVID-19 tests had loss of taste/smell, versus one per cent of kids who tested negative.
And four per cent had nausea or vomiting, versus less than one per cent of those who tested negative.
Headache was a symptom in 16 per cent of positive cases, compared to six per cent in negative cases, and 26 per cent of positive cases had fever, compared to 15 per cent of negative cases.
Symptoms in hospitalized kids differ
Dr. Finlay McAlister, one of the authors of the study, says those symptoms were associated more with having coronavirus rather than some other virus.
He said cough, runny nose and sore throat were equally common symptoms in kids who didn't have coronavirus but may have had another virus.
Symptoms of fever or chills, cough and runny nose in this study (19 to 26 per cent) were less frequent than in studies conducted in hospital settings.
The authors of the study suggest that was because this was a community-based cohort and cases of disease were likely more mild than those seen in hospitals.
Children aged four and younger were more likely to test negative, and teenagers (ages 13 to 17) were more likely to test positive.
Given the name Eris by experts, the variant of the widespread Omicron strain has seen a huge surge in cases, with one in seven infected now believed to have caught it
A new coronavirus variant has hit UK shores with numbers rising up and down the country.
Given the name Eris by experts, the variant of the widespread Omicron strain has seen a huge surge in cases, with one in seven infected now believed to have caught it.
On July 1, 3.3 people out of everyone 100,000 had Covid – but that has now jumped significantly, with 7.2 having it as of July 29.
And it is thought that the new strain is to blame.
Eris hit our shores in early May, with the World Health Organisation adding it to its watch list under the identification of EG.5.1 soon after.
It is not currently listed as a variant of concern, with Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency stating: “We continue to see a rise in Covid-19 cases in this week’s report.
“We have also seen a small rise in hospital admission rates in most age groups, particularly among the elderly.
Overall levels of admission still remain extremely low and we are not currently seeing a similar increase in ICU admissions.
We will continue to monitor these rates closely.”
10 symptoms of Eris strain
Sore throat Runny nose Blocked nose Sneezing Dry cough Headache Wet cough Hoarse voice Muscle aches Altered smell
According to the Zoe Health Study, the main symptoms are similar to the heavily publicised Omicron ones.
These are a sore throat, a runny nose, a blocked nose, sneezing, a cough without phlegm, a headache, a cough with phlegm, a hoarse voice, muscle aches and pains and an altered sense of smell.
However, shortness of breath, a loss of smell and a fever are no longer the main symptoms.
Speaking to the MailOnline, Professor Lawrence Young, a virologist at Warwick University said that the rise in cases could be down ot the recent horrific weather, and a rise in people going to the cinema . . .
presumably to see Barbie or Oppenheimer.
He warned: “Overall levels of infection remain low but this is a wake up call stressing that we can’t be complacent when it comes to Covid.
We need to keep an eye on the emergence of variants and be vigilant as we prepare for an inevitable increase in infections over the autumn/winter.”
On November 10, Hugh Grant revealed on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert that he and his wife both had symptoms of COVID-19 earlier this year—and one symptom in particular made him worry.
Grant said he started to notice his symptoms back in February.
“It started as a very strange syndrome where I kept breaking into a terrible sweat, like a poncho of sweat, embarrassing really,” he told Colbert in the interview.
“Then my eyeballs felt about three sizes too big and this feeling as though some enormous man was sitting on my chest.
… I thought, I don't know what this is.”
Then Grant said he was walking down a street one day and realized he'd lost his sense of smell.
“I thought, I can't smell a damn thing, and you start to panic,” he said.
At that point, people had just started to talk about losing your sense of taste or smell as a possible symptom of COVID-19.
“I started sniffing flowers—nothing,” Grant said.
Then he got “more and more desperate,” eventually moving on to sniffing garbage cans.
“You want to sniff strangers' armpits because you just can't smell anything.”
Later when he went home, he said, he sprayed his wife's Chanel No. 5 directly into his face.
“I couldn't smell a thing, but I did go blind,” he joked.
Losing your sense of taste or smell may seem like one of the odder symptoms of COVID-19, but it is actually a fairly common symptom of other viral illnesses as well.
However, it also tends to be one of the more persistent symptoms of the infection, research shows.
In one study of 202 patients who had COVID-19, 113 reported losing their sense of taste or smell.
Of those, about half (55 participants) recovered their sense of taste and smell within four weeks, and 10% (12 people) reported that they still were experiencing a loss of taste and smell at that point.
The other common symptoms of COVID-19 include a fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, headache, fatigue, congestion, nausea, and vomiting.
Because many of those symptoms overlap with the common symptoms of the seasonal flu, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say that having those along with the loss of taste or smell is a good indicator that someone might have COVID-19 rather than the flu.
In either case, though, it's a good idea to check in with a doctor if you have those symptoms to see whether a flu test or COVID-19 test might be appropriate.
Grant didn't say he had a COVID-19 test at the time, but did say that he had an antibody test about a month ago.
“We have antibodies, and I'm rather proud of them,” he said.
“I still have those antibodies, so I know that's what it was.”
Antibody tests look for the presence of antibodies that the body makes in response to an infection, SELF explained previously, and experts generally caution against reading too much into the results.
But in the absence of a test during the active infection, a positive antibody test could give some context to symptoms like those Grant experienced.
Crucially, though, experts say that a positive antibody test is not necessarily evidence of overall “immunity” to the coronavirus.
At this point, Grant and his wife have both recovered safely from COVID-19 and are quarantining at home with their three young children.

By now, we all should have memorized the key symptoms of the novel coronavirus that public health officials have hammered home: fever, cough, and trouble breathing.
However, that message may have given some who thought they had to have all three symptoms at once a false sense of security.
The earliest reports on the disease caused by COVID-19 were based on patients sick enough to see a doctor or go to a hospital.
Many had the three symptoms.
As we practice social distancing, though, an important question becomes: How does this disease start?
Knowing the early symptoms could help people know when to isolate themselves even more and talk to their doctors about testing.

While hundreds of thousands of people have contracted COVID-19 over the last few months, information about its earliest stages has been slow to trickle out.
Doctors said there are still important gaps in what they know.
And, unfortunately, many of the early symptoms of COVID-19 overlap with other common health problems.
“There is no clearly defined syndrome at this point," said Nuala Meyer, a pulmonary and critical-care medicine doctor at Penn Medicine.
What we know
Symptoms can be subtle.
It is known that some people infected have no symptoms or ones so mild that they’re not noticed.
Daniel Mueller, an infectious diseases doctor at Temple University Hospital, said infected people might feel “just slightly under the weather for a few days.…
They might just feel a little tired or a little achy."
It’s the sort of feeling you’d have if you thought you were coming down with something, but nothing very worrisome.
Then they might start having a dry cough.
Later, in some people, shortness of breath comes on.
“They don’t always happen together,” Mueller said.
It’s not like the flu.
Unlike the flu, which announces itself suddenly with fever and muscle aches, the early stages of COVID-19 can go on for a few days.
Reynold A. Panettieri Jr., vice chancellor for clinical and translational science at Rutgers University, said some mild cases last just three to four days.
Others who are not sick enough for hospitalization still may have symptoms for two weeks.
Presentation of the disease is, he said, “very individualistic and very heterogeneous."
Some people are barely affected and some have “shaking chills” and muscle aches, he said.
Shortness of breath may manifest in two to three days.
More severe symptoms may portend a rougher course, but it’s not yet clear if they do.
“You just don’t know whether they’re going to progress," he said.
In severe cases, patients develop pneumonia and need help breathing.
“The susceptibility to progression is unclear.”
Fever?
Yes and no.
Meyer would add sore throat to the list of early symptoms.
She said most patients will eventually have a fever, but it “may not be in the first five days.”
A report about the outbreak in China published in the New England Journal of Medicine said about 44% of COVID-19 patients had a fever when admitted to a hospital and 88% developed one during their stay.
The researchers warned that cases could be missed if doctors considered fever part of the case definition.
Gastrointestinal symptoms and spread
A rarely mentioned early symptom is gastrointestinal distress.
About 10% of cases can start with a couple of days of diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting and then respiratory symptoms develop, said David A. Johnson, chief of gastroenterology at Eastern Virginia Medical School, who has reviewed studies on the new disease.
He said this makes sense because the virus first targets a type of cell that lives both in the lungs and in parts of the digestive tract.
There is evidence of viral shedding in feces, he said.
That is not proof that virus in the stool is infectious, he said, but is reason to worry that the disease can be transmitted through a fecal-oral route.
It’s another argument for good hand hygiene and bathroom cleaning.
In a Chinese study, the shedding continued for up to 12 days after people tested negative for the virus, he said.

Gavin Macgregor-Skinner, an assistant professor in the department of public health at the Penn State University College of Medicine, trains people in hospitals and other organizations in infection prevention and control.
He said he is frustrated by the lack of information this many weeks into a pandemic.
He said medical journals can be too slow to provide information, and doctors should find quicker ways, such as a clearinghouse, to share data.
For now, he is asking the 37 members of his prevention team to take their own temperatures in the morning and evening.
That way they’ll know their personal baseline.
If the temperature goes up, he wants them to stop working and test every three hours.
He said he doesn’t know whether fever is the first symptom, but added that low-grade fever is “definitely present” in the disease.
He also wants people to stay away from others if they have any respiratory symptoms.
He agreed that breathing difficulty is not an early sign of the disease.
He didn’t know about gastrointestinal symptoms, but he had strong words about infection control when fecal-oral transmission is a possibility.
Active virus in feces can spray into the room when you flush; so, close the lid when flushing.
You shouldn’t have personal items near the toilet, he said: “Don’t have your toothbrush next to your toilet, ever.”
Mueller said the three major symptoms — fever, cough, and shortness of breath — warrant a call to the doctor and a discussion about whether to be tested.
He would set the threshold lower for transplant patients or those with chronic heart and lung disease.
Shortness of breath could be a sign of pneumonia and should get immediate attention, he said.
Symptoms involving the eyes and nose
The American Academy of Ophthalmology on March 25 issued a warning to its members that some patients with conjunctivitis, an inflammation of the thin, transparent tissue that lines eyelids and part of the eye also known as pink eye, can be an early sign of coronavirus.
It suggested that eye doctors wear full face protection covering eyes, ears and mouth, particularly when patients also have fever and respiratory symptoms.
The organization cited two studies from China that involved patients hospitalized for the new disease.
One found viral conjunctivitis in 1 of 30 patients.
The other found it in 9 of 1,099 (0.8%) lab-confirmed cases.
British ear, nose and throat doctors have also raised the alarm that loss of the sense of smell can be a symptom.
In a statement, ENTUK said there is “good evidence” from South Korea, China and Italy that pepole with COVID-19 infection can experience total loss of the sense of smell (asnosmia) or a decline.
“In Germany it is reported that more than two in three confirmed cases have anosmia,” they wrote.
“In South Korea, where testing has been more widespread, 30% of patients testing positive have had anosmia as their major presenting symptom in otherwise mild cases.”

Omicron: Dr Amir talks through the symptoms of the new strain
Signs of the fast-spreading Omicron variant have been found to be quite different to previous strains of Covid.
Here’s one sign on your skin that could indicate that you've been infected with the virus
Worrying Omicron symptom on your skin that could be a sign of Covid
As Omicron spreads across the UK, people have been presenting with various signs of infection that we haven’t seen with previous Covid variants.
Experts have already warned that symptoms of Omicron are quite different to the traditional signs of coronavirus, which includes a new and continuous cough, fever and loss/change to your smell and taste.
Unlike previous variants like Delta, symptoms of this super mutant strain has been found to be similar to a common cold.
And though they are described as "extremely mild," Omicron symptoms seem to be targeting different parts of the body.

Here's one sign on the skin that many patients who have tested positive for Omicron have reported.
What is the telltale sign on the skin that could be a sign of Omicron?
One of the lesser-known but common symptoms of Omicron is a skin rash, according to the ZOE COVID Study app.
Described as “a fourth key sign” of the coronavirus infection, there have been two types of rashes reported by Covid positive patients.
The first is a hive-type rash that comes on suddenly in the form of raised bumps on your skin.
These tend to be very itchy and often start with intense itching of the palms or soles.
The second type is a prickly heat rash that comes on as areas of small, itchy, red bumps.
Though they can appear anywhere on the body, this kind of rash tends to be most common on elbows, knees and the backs of hands and feet.
While the hive-type rashes tend to come and go quickly, the prickly heat rash can persist for days or weeks, according to ZOE.

Another common skin sign has been the Covid fingers and toes, also known as chilblains.
These appear as red and purple bumps on fingers and toes, which could feel sore.
Unlike the rashes, these are not usually itchy and tend to be more common with younger people with the virus.
Research has shown that these skin symptoms can appear even when there are no other symptoms linked to Covid present.

Other common symptoms of Omicron that are different from the original coronavirus symptoms include:
Scratchy throat
Runny nose
Sneezing
Mild muscle aches
Extreme tiredness
Night sweats
Some other symptoms that have been reported include congestion and brain fog.
Dr Angelique Coetzee, who first raised the alarm on the new variant, also noted that certain symptoms like headaches and sore muscles are felt more intensely, especially by those who are unvaccinated.
What should I do if I have Covid symptoms?
If you believe that you have Covid or are experiencing any symptoms, the NHS advises that you should:
Get a PCR test as soon as possible.
Stay at home and self-isolate.
You should not have visitors until you get your test result and only leave your home to have a test.
You should also check if people you live with need to self-isolate.
Anyone who has Covid can infect others from around two days before symptoms start and for up to 10 days after, even if you have mild or no symptoms.
COVID-19 cases are once again rising, and the omicron variant of the coronavirus, which appears to spread more quickly than previous variants but results in milder disease, is fueling the surge.
The rising number of cases has led to a slew of questions about the state of the COVID-19 pandemic, including what to do if you test positive for the virus.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidance for how long people should quarantine or isolate after a possible exposure to COVID-19 or if they test positive for SARS-CoV-2.
In general, the CDC recommends people isolate for at least five days after they test positive.
If after day five their symptoms are improving or they have remained asymptomatic, they can leave isolation and wear a mask around others, the CDC says.
Boosted and recently vaccinated people do not need to stay at home if they are possibly exposed to the coronavirus but should wear a mask for 10 days.
People who are unvaccinated or have gone more than six months since receiving an mRNA vaccine or two months since the Johnson & Johnson vaccine should stay at home for at least five days and then wear a mask around others for five additional days, the CDC says.
But the new guidance has led some to criticize the CDC.
Dr. Rochelle Walensky has said the guidelines come amid changing understanding of the virus's transmissibility and the rise in omicron cases.
“We want to make sure there is a mechanism by which we can safely continue to keep society functioning while following the science,” she said Dec. 27.
In Michigan, the state health department said it wouldn't be following the relaxing guidelines, and the White House's top adviser on the coronavirus pandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said the CDC was "very well aware" of the pushback.
Fauci is head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, separate from the CDC.

How long is someone contagious after they test positive for COVID-19?
The exact amount of time someone is contagious after a positive test can vary depending on a number of factors – such as whether they are symptomatic or how long after exposure they tested positive.
The CDC says most transmission of the coronavirus occurs within one to two days before the onset of symptoms and two to three days after.
In an appearance on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," Walensky said that 80% to 90% of a person's transmissibility is believed to occur within that five-day period before symptom onset and after.
The spread of omicron:Here’s what you need to know
Wearing cloth masks?
Here's why that's a problem with omicron
While that represents the majority of transmission, it may still be possible for someone to be contagious before or after or if they remain asymptomatic.
"We know that these tests can stay positive for a while,” Purvi Parikh, an allergist and immunologist with the Allergy and Asthma Network, told USA TODAY in December.
“After 10 days, it's very unlikely you’ll be contagious.”
When is the best time to test for the coronavirus after symptoms start?
The CDC says that if you develop symptoms, get tested immediately and isolate until you receive the results.
If you do not develop symptoms, the CDC says, you should test at least five days after exposure.
While testing before or after may still detect the presence of the coronavirus, five days after exposure is the optimal time, according to the CDC.
What is an antigen test?
What is a PCR test?
Most self-tests are rapid antigen tests, which can detect the virus when a person is infectious and likely to pass it to others.
The tests detect a viral protein on the surface of the coronavirus.
A negative antigen test, however, should be "presumptive" in most cases, the CDC says, and may require additional confirmation.
Antigen tests work best when a person's viral load is highest, meaning a test early on in an infection or at a later stage may lead to a negative result, according to the CDC.
If someone receives a negative antigen test early on an infection, they may be contagious later and would test positive.
Molecular PCR tests are more sensitive and can detect traces of the virus over a longer period during the course of an infection.
They are part of a larger class of tests called nucleic acid amplification tests, or NAATs.
Though some PCR tests can be performed at home, most are administered at clinics, doctors’ offices, hospitals or large-scale testing sites.
PCR tests and other NAATs may remain positive for weeks to months after an infection when a person is no longer contagious, according to the CDC.
They remain the "gold standard" for diagnosis, the CDC says.
Omicron and rapid tests:Here's what you need to know
What does a COVID-19 positive self-test result mean?
If someone tests positive for the coronavirus, regardless of vaccination status, the CDC says they should stay home and isolate for at least five days.
After five days, if that person remains asymptomatic or their symptoms are resolving, they can leave home if they wear a mask around others to reduce the risk of transmission, the CDC says.
CDC guidance before the late December update said people who were positive should isolate for 10 days starting on the first full day after developing symptoms.
Asymptomatic people were told to isolate for 10 days after their positive test result under the old guidance.
If I test positive, how do I isolate?
Isolation is intended for people who have tested positive for the virus.
People who isolate should stay at home and stay away from others inside their household.
The CDC says a designated "sick room" and bathroom should be used for the infected person.
If I am possibly exposed to COVID-19, how do I quarantine?
Quarantine is different from isolation because it is intended for people who may have had an exposure to COVID-19, the CDC says.
If someone is exposed to COVID-19 but they are vaccinated and boosted, they do not need to remain at home for a quarantine period unless they develop symptoms, the CDC says.
They should, however, wear a mask around others for 10 days.

The CDC says people should remain at home for five days to quarantine if they are not vaccinated, they are not boosted, or it has been more than six months since receiving the Pfizer or Moderna shots or more than two months since the Johnson & Johnson shot.
After five days, they can leave home but should wear a mask around others.
If they cannot quarantine, they should wear a mask around others for 10 days, the CDC says.
If they develop symptoms at any point, they should stay at home.
All people, regardless of vaccination status, should also take a test at Day 5, if possible, after an exposure to the virus, the CDC says.
Am I free to leave quarantine after five days if I take a COVID-19 test?
The CDC guidance says you should wear a mask around others for 10 days if you've had a possible exposure.
While on "Colbert," Walensky addressed the question of how to interpret an antigen test five days after an exposure.
"If it's positive, stay home for another five days.
If it's negative, I would say you still really need to wear a mask.
You still may have some transmissibility ahead of you.
You still should probably not visit Grandma.
You shouldn't get on an airplane, and you should still be pretty careful when you're with other people by wearing a mask all the time.
"

What over-the-counter medication can I take if I test positive for COVID-19?
Dr. Anita Gupta, adjunct assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, told USA TODAY people who test positive for the coronavirus can take popular pain relief medication like acetaminophen or ibuprofen for aches and pains.
“That typically will lower the fever and help them just feel OK,” Gupta said.
But she noted that recommendations for pain relief medication may differ for children or older individuals.
And over-the-counter medications won’t treat “the virus, but they’re just going to keep people generally comfortable.”
Gupta said people experiencing dry coughs can use cough medicine that contains dextromethorphan for some relief, while people with a productive cough may want to use medicine that contains guaifenesin.
But cough medications shouldn’t be used for “a prolonged period of time.”
“If you’re going to manage COVID-19 at home, really the most important thing is to just get rest.
Stay hydrated.
These medications are not going to make COVID-19 go away faster,” Gupta said.
Additionally, over-the-counter vitamins have not been proven to treat or prevent COVID-19.
Fact check:Over-the-counter vitamins not proven to treat, prevent COVID-19
How long does it take to recover from COVID-19?
Most people who test positive for the virusrecover in a few weeks, according to the Mayo Clinic.
And health officials say most people are able to recover from the virus at home.
But millions of Americans have taken months to recover from COVID-19 or are still struggling with their illness.
These “long-haulers” may face a wide range of symptoms, including breathlessness, brain fog, pain and more.
For millions, COVID-19 won’t quit:Doctors strive for answers on how to ease long-hauler misery.
What treatments are available for COVID-19?
The Food and Drug Administration last month authorized use of two antiviral medications, Pfizer’s Paxlovid and molnupiravir.
Paxlovid can prevent nearly 90% of severe COVID-19 among those at high risk, and molnupiravir can prevent severe illness about 30% of the time.
Monoclonal antibodies, or drugs derived from people whose immune systems have fought off COVID-19, have helped people across the country at risk for severe symptoms from COVID-19, among other treatments.
But experts are warning that two widely used monoclonal antibodies are not likely to be effective against the spread of COVID-19's omicron variant.
Some health care providers have been scrambling to get enough doses of a third monoclonal antibody treatment that appears to be effective against the variant.
New COVID treatments are coming:Will they help combat the omicron onslaught?

Nearly 18 months after getting COVID-19 and spending weeks in the hospital, Terry Bell struggles with hanging up his shirts and pants after doing the laundry.
Lifting his clothes, raising his arms, arranging items in his closet leave Bell short of breath and often trigger severe fatigue.
He walks with a cane, only short distances.
He's 50 pounds lighter than when the virus struck.
Bell, 70, is among millions of older adults who have grappled with long COVID — a population that has received little attention even though research suggests seniors are more likely to develop the poorly understood condition than younger or middle-aged adults.
Long COVID refers to ongoing or new health problems that occur at least four weeks after a COVID infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Much about the condition is baffling: There is no diagnostic test to confirm it, no standard definition of the ailment, and no way to predict who will be affected.
Common symptoms, which can last months or years, include fatigue, shortness of breath, an elevated heart rate, muscle and joint pain, sleep disruptions, and problems with attention, concentration, language, and memory — a set of difficulties known as brain fog.
Ongoing inflammation or a dysfunctional immune response may be responsible, along with reservoirs of the virus that remain in the body, small blood clots, or residual damage to the heart, lungs, vascular system, brain, kidneys, or other organs.
Only now is the impact on older adults beginning to be documented.
In the largest study of its kind, published recently in the journal BMJ, researchers estimated that 32% of older adults in the U.S. who survived COVID infections had symptoms of long COVID up to four months after infection — more than double the 14% rate an earlier study found in adults ages 18 to 64.
(Other studies suggest symptoms can last much longer, for a year or more.)
The BMJ study examined more than 87,000 adults 65 and older who had COVID infections in 2020, drawing on claims data from UnitedHealth Group's Medicare Advantage plans.
It included symptoms that lasted 21 days or more after an infection, a shorter period than the CDC uses in its long COVID definition.
The data encompasses both older adults who were hospitalized because of COVID (27%) and those who were not (73%).
The higher rate of post-COVID symptoms in older adults is likely due to a higher incidence of chronic disease and physical vulnerability in this population — traits that have led to a greater burden of serious illness, hospitalization, and death among seniors throughout the pandemic.
"On average, older adults are less resilient.
They don't have the same ability to bounce back from serious illness," said Dr. Ken Cohen, a co-author of the study and executive director of translational research for Optum Care.
Optum Care is a network of physician practices owned by UnitedHealth Group.
Applying the study's findings to the latest data from the CDC suggests that up to 2.5 million older adults may have been affected by long COVID.
For those individuals, the consequences can be devastating: the onset of disability, the inability to work, reduced ability to carry out activities of daily life, and a lower quality of life.
But in many seniors, long COVID is difficult to recognize.
"The challenge is that nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, pain, confusion, and increased frailty are things we often see in seriously ill older adults.
Or people may think, 'That's just part of aging,'" said Dr. Charles Thomas Alexander Semelka, a postdoctoral fellow in geriatric medicine at Wake Forest University.
Ann Morse, 72, of Nashville, Tennessee, was diagnosed with COVID in November 2020 and recovered at home after a trip to the emergency room and follow-up home visits from nurses every few days.
She soon began having trouble with her memory, attention, and speech, as well as sleep problems and severe fatigue.
Though she's improved somewhat, several cognitive issues and fatigue persist to this day.
"What was frustrating was I would tell people my symptoms and they'd say, 'Oh, we're like that too,' as if this was about getting older," she told me.
"And I'm like, but this happened to me suddenly, almost overnight.
"
Bell, a singer-songwriter in Nashville, had a hard time getting adequate follow-up attention after spending two weeks in intensive care and an additional five weeks in a nursing home receiving rehabilitation therapy.
"I wasn't getting answers from my regular doctors about my breathing and other issues.
They said take some over-the-counter medications for your sinus and things like that," he said.
Bell said his real recovery began after he was recommended to specialists at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
James Jackson, director of long-term outcomes at Vanderbilt's Critical Illness, Brain Dysfunction, and Survivorship Center, runs several long COVID support groups that Morse and Bell attend and has worked with hundreds of similar patients.
He estimates that about a third of those who are older have some degree of cognitive impairment.
"We know there are significant differences between younger and older brains.
Younger brains are more plastic and effective at reconstituting, and our younger patients seem able to regain their cognitive functioning more quickly," he said.
In extreme cases, COVID infections can lead to dementia.
That may be because older adults who are severely ill with COVID are at high risk of developing delirium — an acute and sudden change in mental status — which is associated with the subsequent development of dementia, said Dr. Liron Sinvani, a geriatrician and an assistant professor at Northwell Health's Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research in Manhasset, New York.
Older patients' brains also may have been injured from oxygen deprivation or inflammation.
Or disease processes that underlie dementia may already have been underway, and a COVID infection may serve as a tipping point, hastening the emergence of symptoms.
Research conducted by Sinvani and colleagues, published in March, found that 13% of COVID patients who were 65 and older and hospitalized at Northwell Health in March 2020 or April 2020 had evidence of dementia a year later.
Dr. Thomas Gut, associate chair of medicine at Staten Island University Hospital, which opened one of the first long COVID clinics in the U.S., observed that becoming ill with COVID can push older adults with preexisting conditions such as heart failure or lung disease "over the edge" to a more severe impairment.
In older adults especially, he said, "it's hard to attribute what's directly related to COVID and what's a progression of conditions they already have.
"
That wasn't true for Richard Gard, 67, who lives just outside New Haven, Connecticut, a self-described "very healthy and fit" sailor, scuba diver, and music teacher at Yale University who contracted COVID in March 2020.
He was the first COVID patient treated at Yale New Haven Hospital, where he was critically ill for 2½ weeks, including five days in intensive care and three days on a ventilator.
In the two years since, Gard has spent more than two months in the hospital, usually for symptoms that resemble a heart attack.
"If I tried to walk up the stairs or 10 feet, I would almost pass out with exhaustion, and the symptoms would start — extreme chest pain radiating up my arm into my neck, trouble breathing, sweating," he said.
Dr. Erica Spatz, director of the preventive cardiovascular health program at Yale, is one of Gard's physicians.
"The more severe the COVID infection and the older you are, the more likely it is you'll have a cardiovascular complication after," she said.
Complications include weakening of the heart muscle, blood clots, abnormal heart rhythms, vascular system damage, and high blood pressure.
Gard's life has changed in ways he never imagined.
Unable to work, he takes 22 medications and can still walk only 10 minutes on level ground.
Post-traumatic stress disorder is a frequent, unwanted companion.
"A lot of times it's been difficult to go on, but I tell myself I just have to get up and try one more time," he told me.
"Every day that I get a little bit better, I tell myself I'm adding another day or week to my life.

LONG Covid can trigger more than 200 symptoms, doctors have discovered by questioning thousands of sufferers.
Researchers led by University College London found these debilitating problems affect 10 organ systems, including the brain, lungs and skin.
2 These were the most common symptoms of long Covid found
The most common symptom was fatigue, affecting almost every patient (98.3 per cent).
Following was post-exertional malaise (the worsening of symptoms after physical or mental exertion), affecting 89 per cent, and brain fog, medically known as cognitive dysfunction (85.1 per cent).
The top three most debilitating symptoms, affecting daily life, were fatigue, breathing issues and brain fog.
Long Covid manifests itself in a huge range of ways, including visual hallucinations, tremors, heart palpitations and memory loss.
Other problems flagged were sexual dysfunction, itchy skin, changes to the menstrual cycles, bladder control issues, shingles, diarrhoea and tinnitus.
And some of the least common and bizzarre were early menopause, change in penis size, "inability to yawn", "inability to cry", sensation of brain "on fire”, and aggression.
The study sheds more light on how coronavirus infection, which usually lasts for around two weeks, impacts some for months more.
Figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest one million people in the UK are currently battling the persistent symptoms.

This is rising fast in line with the growing third wave.
Experts estimate 500 new cases of long Covid per day.
The ONS have estimated that one in seven people have some symptoms 12 weeks after a positive test result.
There are still many unknowns about “long haulers” - who is most at risk and how best to treat it, for example.
Senior author Dr Athena Akrami, a neuroscientist at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre at UCL, said: “In this unique approach, we have gone directly to ‘long haulers’ around the world in order to establish a foundation of evidence...
“This is the most comprehensive characterisation of long Covid symptoms, so far.”
200+ symptoms
Almost 3,400 people with either confirmed or suspected Covid infection from 56 countries responded to an online survey.
From there, researchers identified a total of 203 symptoms in 10 organ systems, according to the findings published today in the Lancet’s EClinicalMedicine.
Dr Akrami said neurological symptoms were particularly prevalent.
"Memory and cognitive dysfunction, experienced by over 85 per cent of respondents, were the most pervasive and persisting neurologic symptoms", Dr Akrami said.

They were equally common across all ages, and with substantial impact on work.
Dr Akrami said: “Headaches, insomnia, vertigo, neuralgia, neuropsychiatric changes, tremors, sensitivity to noise and light, hallucinations, tinnitus, and other sensorimotor symptoms were also all common, and may point to larger neurological issues involving both the central and peripheral nervous system.”
Of the thousands of respondents, only 233 had said they had recovered.
Two-thirds (65 per cent) had been suffering for six months, and were still experiencing and average of 14 symptoms in month seven.
Agony for months
Along with the top three symptoms, the most common were sensorimotor symptoms (difficulting moving or feeling sensation), headaches, memory issues, insomnia, heart palpitations and muscle aches.
Some 96 per cent had persistent symptoms for at least 90 days (three months), plagued by an average of 17 symptoms.
The majority of participants (89 per cent) had “relapses”, mostly triggered by exercise, physical or mental activity, and stress.
Almost half (45 per cent) said they had cut down on their work hours, while over a fifth (22 per cent) were not working at all at the time of the survey.
The research team, who have all had or continue to have long Covid, fear there are many long haulers “suffering in silence”.
They are now calling for expanded clinical guidelines on assessing long Covid so that more diagnoses are made and a national screening programme, accessible to anyone who thinks they have long Covid.
It comes after a study reealed that only a minority of long Covid cases were being recorded by GPs.
Previous research estimated that as many as two million people in England are suffering ongoing symptoms.
But experts led by Oxford University found that only 23,273 cases (1 per cent) were formally recorded between February 2020 and April 2021 at GP practices.
SINGAPORE:
An employee at SLR Revolution camera shop in Excelsior Shopping Centre who tested positive for COVID-19 had "a mild symptom" the night before he went to work, the store said on Friday (Aug 28).
The employee, a 61-year-old Singaporean man, was reported by the Ministry of Health (MOH) as having tested positive on Aug 20 after having onset of symptoms on Aug 17.
SLR Revolution said in response to CNA’s queries that the man had reported for work on Aug 18 after experiencing a “mild symptom” the night before.
"On the morning of 18th, he felt well and proceeded to work.
Halfway through, he felt symptoms again and he left to see a doctor immediately," said SLR Revolution general manager Jeremy Loh, adding that the employee has been on medical leave since.
The man has so far been linked to a 65-year-old Singaporean woman who tested positive for the disease on Aug 23.
MOH on Thursday also reported that a 31-year-old Singaporean woman tested positive after visiting the shop on Aug 17, and "may have had contact" with the employee.
The woman first had symptoms on Aug 22 and was confirmed with COVID-19 on Aug 26.
MOH also said on Thursday that while the risk for visitors is assessed to be low, it will be contacting everyone who visited the shop between Aug 15 and Aug 18, and facilitating COVID-19 testing for them.
When asked about the 31-year-old woman who had visited the store and the extent of the contact she might have had, Mr Loh said: “We are unsure which customer is infected as MOH is unable to reveal, hence we are unable to know the duration spent.
“On average, a customer spends about 10 to 30 minutes in our shop depending on the item purchased.
“They will not have physical contact.
Contact only happens if both the sales person and the customer touch the same item.”
Mr Loh added that the retailer was not aware that COVID-19 cases had visited the store until it was informed by MOH during contact tracing on Thursday afternoon.
On its contact tracing efforts, Mr Loh said SLR Revolution has been working with MOH.
“We have provided access for our safe entry to MOH, as well as CCTV footage to police officers assisting in contact tracing.
“Our affected employee has also tried his best to provide details of all his contacts for that last few days to MOH, the rest of the staff has also helped the affected employee in case he missed out anyone,” he said.
In a Facebook post on Aug 20, SLR Revolution said that its Excelsior Shopping Centre branch would close temporarily after an employee was confirmed to have COVID-19.
It added that staff members who worked at the branch would be quarantined for 14 days and its premises would be disinfected.
On Aug 25, SLR Revolution wrote that all employees from its Excelsior branch had tested negative for COVID-19, but that they would not return to work until Sep 1.
The company said the team from its Jurong Point branch - which did not have any interaction with employees at the Excelsior outlet - would be stationed at the shop at Excelsior Shopping Centre when it resumed operations on Friday.
Mr Loh told CNA on Friday the store had engaged cleaning company approved by the National Environment Agency on Aug 21 - a day after the employee tested positive for the disease - to disinfect the shop.

In a recent study published in PLOS ONE, researchers reported the findings from a pilot interview study that was conducted to gain insights into the new and persistent symptoms experienced by long coronavirus disease (COVID) patients and to obtain data for the study design and participant recruitment for the Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission-Long COVID (REACT-LC) study.
Background
Long COVID is the commonly used term for various persistent symptoms experienced by individuals who have recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections.
These symptoms are not restricted to the respiratory system and affect many organ systems, including the nervous, cardiac, skeletal, muscular, renal, and digestive systems.
Since much of the early focus of governments and healthcare organizations was on controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and decreasing the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the initiative to form support groups and raise awareness about long COVID was led by patients.
Studies that have explored long COVID symptoms have recruited participants from many of these support groups through social media and clinical services established to help long COVID patients.
This strategy could result in excluding long COVID patients who, for various reasons, have yet to join long COVID support groups.
The REACT-LC study aims to build on the REACT (Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission) study, which quantified the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a random cross-section of the population of England, to identify the social, environmental, biological, and genetic basis of long COVID progression.
About the study
In the present study, the researchers conducted pilot interviews among individuals who were not hospitalized but had a documented history of COVID-19, with or without persistent symptoms.
The aim was to identify biological and genetic pathways that could explain individual differences in response to COVID-19.
The participants for the pilot study were recruited from the individuals registered at the REACT-LC clinical assessment centers and belonged to the age group of 18 to 34 years.
Research interviews were conducted immediately after the clinical assessment of the REACT-LC participants.
The topic guide explored the acute symptoms experienced during the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, the persistent and new symptoms that appeared after recovering from COVID-19, and the access to support for long COVID patients.
A thematic analysis was conducted on the recorded semi-structured interviews.
Results
The results indicated that the 13 participants, comprising six females and seven males with a median age of 31, reported various fluctuating persistent and new symptoms.
While some participants were confident about the association between their symptoms and the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, other participants expressed a lack of clarity about the cause of the symptoms or felt that the COVID-19-associated lockdowns and other public health measures might have influenced the symptoms.
The persistent symptoms consisted of dyspnea, headaches, low energy, lack of smell or taste, fatigue, and in some cases, persistently high temperature.
Most of the persistent symptoms seemed to occur during the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and continued well after recovering from acute COVID-19.
The participants reported that the symptoms were unpredictable and sometimes cyclical.
In one case, the individual recovered enough to resume normal activities and exercise and then experienced a relapse.
The new symptoms, which occurred after recovering from the initial infection, were inconsistent across individuals and varied widely.
While some of these new symptoms were common, such as sore throat, headaches, temperature, and fatigue, others, such as loss of coordination, changes in vision, chest pain, weight change, and pins and needles, were more uncommon.
In some cases, there was a significant gap between recovering from COVID-19 and the onset of new symptoms.
Some of the female participants reported changes associated with the menstrual cycles, with increased pain and worsening of long COVID symptoms during the periods.
The severity of the symptoms varied across individuals, with some reporting breathlessness and needing an inhaler after running.
In contrast, another individual experienced breathlessness severe enough to affect daily activities such as showering.
While some of the participants were aware of long COVID, many of them did not consider their symptoms as a distinct disease or severe enough to diagnose.
The authors believe that previous studies on long COVID that recruited participants from support groups run the risk of excluding the insights of individuals with new or persistent symptoms who do not recognize their symptoms as those of long COVID.
This could result in reduced access to healthcare and support for these individuals to manage their long COVID symptoms.
Conclusions
Overall, despite the small sample size of this pilot interview study, the results reported a wide variation in the type and severity of symptoms and in the understanding of long COVID among individuals experiencing new and persistent symptoms after recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infections.
The findings highlight the need for wider and varied inclusion of participants with long COVID symptoms while designing studies to understand the disease.
Quarantine life is already enough fun when you still have a sense of smell.
I realized mine was gone about a week and a half ago.
I’d already had two solid days of what I assumed to be (mild) symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus: head and body aches, fatigue, a slight fever.
The night between, I had some serious chills.
Overall, I was relatively lucky—though I don’t know for sure that I had it, since it is at this point unethical for me to seek a test that could go to better use.
But it was only after the flu-like symptoms abated that I realized I was unable to smell food.
Actually, a lot of the taste was stripped out of things as well.
Because why shouldn’t one of the few remaining pleasures afforded to those of us blessed to live in the Year of Our Lord 2020—eating on the couch—get scratched off, too, along with "going places" and "doing things"?
To be clear, this wasn’t a zero-smell situation.
There wasn’t nothing, some total absence of sensory input.
There was something there that would flare up every time an external scent came wafting in.
I would describe it as the scent of synthetic death, like some sort of chemical fire burned through the back of my nasal cavity and left a desiccated forest of nerve endings behind.
When some odor would come billowing in, it would only succeed in activating the burnt-out nerves, like wind kicking up ash.
Occasionally, the actual smell would poke through the smoke with around five or ten percent of its normal intensity.
But the overwhelming sense was the back of my nose had become the California foothills during fire season.
Talking to some other folks here in New York—now d.b.a.
The Epicenter—I personally know at least three people who believe they had COVID-19 and lost their sense of smell in the bargain.
In fact, it's emerging as a fairly common symptom.
To find out how common, and what the hell is happening here, I called up Claire Hopkins, a professor of Rhinology at King's College London and a consultant ear, nose and throat surgeon.
As president of the British Rhinological Society, Hopkins released a statement last month on the organization's behalf tracing the growing evidence that anosmia is a symptom of the disease at the center of this worldwide pandemic.
"We often see post-viral anosmia," Hopkins told me, explaining they usually see it in patients who have the common cold and, because their noses are blocked up and stuffy, have lost some of their smelling capabilities.
"But early on in the pandemic, I saw four patients in a row who were all young and healthy, who had, really in the absence of any other symptoms, lost their sense of smell.
At the same time, I'd been participating in doctors' forums online, and colleagues from Italy had noticed that, amongst the doctors on the frontline, there were high numbers who had lost their sense of smell, and they speculated that this may be a sign of otherwise asymptomatic infection.
"
"Amongst the doctors on the frontline, there were high numbers who had lost their sense of smell.
"
Around that point, Hopkins had a choice to make that became a question of medical ethics.
On one hand, there was not much peer-reviewed evidence—the kind that scientists and doctors normally base their decisions on—of the link between COVID-19 and anosmia.
In ordinary times, it would be unethical for the British Rhinological Society to make a statement on the possible connection.
But these were not ordinary times, and she began to worry that her colleagues in the field were at risk—particularly dangerous risk, because being an ear, nose, and throat doctor means getting up in people's faces, using tools that often cause patients to cough or sneeze—of contracting the virus from otherwise asymptomatic patients.
(Regardless of what the governor of Georgia says, we have known for some time that asymptomatic spreaders pose a particular danger.)
At the time, Hopkins was only using personal protective equipment (PPE) when seeing patients with respiratory distress, cough, or fever, and presumably so were most her colleagues in the field.
Reports began to indicate there were high rates of COVID-19 infection in ENT doctors.
Because part of her mandate is to look out for her colleagues' safety, she decided to go public using what she believed to be strong anecdotal evidence.
"I thought if we could include loss of sense of smell as one of the triggers to self-isolate," Hopkins says, "we might really reduce the risk of onward transmission.
"

Since then, researchers at Kings College London have developed an app, called the COVID-19 Symptom Tracker, for British citizens to document their Coronavirus Experience.
It now has around 2 million users, Hopkins says, as Britons are encouraged to map their symptoms on a daily basis, even if they're feeling well.
The goal is to learn more about the onset of the infection and "identify which symptoms occur at which stage of the disease."
When Hopkins first put out the organization's statement, loss of smell was not included among the app's options.
But she got in contact with the development team and convinced them to add it.
The app team released a statement this week announcing that sense of smell is "actually the strongest symptom to predict infection," according to Hopkins, including when compared to fever.
They found 60 percent of patients who tested positive had lost their sense of smell, while in those that tested negative, only 18 percent had anosmia symptoms.
This offers more specificity than a fever, which was commonly found in those who tested negatively.
The takeaway, Hopkins says, was that "anyone with new onset loss of sense of smell should be self-isolating, and ideally tested."
It's an early warning sign.
Hopkins has developed a cohort of around 2,500 patients she's monitoring, and while the exact timeline of when anosmia occurs still isn't clear, she says around one-in-four lost their sense of smell before developing any other symptoms.
Another one-in-four develop it around the same time as other symptoms, and for the other half, it comes after.
I was also interested in the mechanics here.
Why does this happen—and in particular, why do I get the smell of synthetic death rather than nothing at all?
Hopkins said the majority of patients report really severe loss.
When they try to smell something, they get nada.
A friend of mine told me this was his experience—he would try to smell coffee or candles and simply smell nothing.
("Onions," he said, "broke through the defenses.")
But Hopkins says others have described "dysosmia"—when you go to smell something and it smells like something...else.
Something unpleasant.
"We think there are problems with the receptors, so that pattern recognition is disrupted," Hopkins says.
"But also, there are other nerves in the nose.
For example, there's the trigeminal nerve, which detects noxious fumes, so it triggers a pain response.
It also picks up thermal regulation.
But it can pick up chemical smells.
So when you smell menthol or cleaning fluids, it's actually stimulating the trigeminal nerve.
When you take out our natural sense of smell, you still get some background stimulations through other pathways, that people often perceive as an unpleasant smell.
So the loss of smell unmasks that background smell.
"
"The loss of smell unmasks that background smell.
"
Apparently, this all has to do with how the virus takes root towards the back of the nose.
"What we know is it's actually sort of an injury to the olfactory nerve, and the olfactory system itself," Hopkins says.
Unlike with smell loss due to the common cold, there's no physical blockage in most COVID-19 patients.
The odor is getting back there, but the receptors are damaged.
"Coronavirus in particular can damage the nerve and then travel along the olfactory nerve to the olfactory bulb, which is the more simple processing part, and of course damage that as well," Hopkins adds.
"Now fortunately, the olfactory nerves have the ability to recover, which is why they're being used in research for spinal cord injury.
So they can regenerate and your sense of smell can return.
"
That was a somewhat crucial question for me.
Is it going to come back?
So far I'd say there's been significant personal improvement, but there are still times when the synth-death comes creeping in.
"There are certainly people who have persistent, severe anosmia after post-viral infections," Hopkins says.
"We know you can get persistent loss.
Coronaviruses are known to cause long-term loss.
Obviously, it's too early to tell what proportion of patients with COVID-19 will have long-term loss, but if you look at studies with post-viral loss in general, at least two thirds will make a good recovery.
But that means that as many as one in three may not fully get their sense of smell back.
In our cohort, at least 60 percent of people were seeing improvement within two weeks, and I just sent out a follow-up again today to try and see people beyond that.
"
And then there's the loss-of-taste situation.
For a while there, everything I was couch-eating was mostly relegated to a texture experience.
I was always under the impression that taste and smell were inextricably linked, that the two senses draw on the same chemicals in food to transmit information to the brain.
This isn't strictly true.

"What we actually taste is sweet, sour, salt, bitter," Hopkins says, "and actually what we describe as 'taste' or 'flavor' actually all comes from sense of smell.
So when we eat, we breathe out through our nose, we smell our food, we describe that flavor.
So when you lose your sense of smell, food tastes very plain.
People will report that they've lost their sense of taste," she adds, but that's something of an illusion.
Unless it's not.
"Actually, we've had some patients describe finding it difficult to differentiate between salty, sour, bitter, and also getting a strange metallic taste.
So it suggests [the infection] might be affecting taste in itself, and that certainly needs further investigation.
What that suggests is that there may be some other central nervous system effects of the virus.
We've also seen people describing change in hearing, and there are other effects, such as headache, drowsiness, severe central nervous system problems, suggesting that the virus can have wide effects within the nervous system.
"
Lovely.
Apart from the time I tried to go for a run the week after my worst symptoms and it felt like I'd been repeatedly roundhouse-kicked in the chest, this is some of the more alarming feedback I've received on my case.
Of course, this is all trivial compared to what many who are infected will experience.
But as far as smell specifically, it does seem that for most people, it will come back.
Hopkins says there's no need to seek medical attention if you lose your smell during the pandemic.
Assume you've got COVID and self-isolate.
If you want to feel like you're doing something about it, you can try "smell training," where you repeatedly smell something to stimulate the nerve and encourage recovery.
But otherwise, there's no specific treatment.
You're mostly at the mercy of the fascinatingly complex systems that make up our bodies and how they interact with the world outside—including the deadly pathogens that have the capability to upend our lives.
Share on Pinterest Children and younger people may not be at high risk for long COVID as previous studies suggested.
Stephanie Keith/Bloomberg via Getty Images Children and young people often report persistent symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In a systematic analysis of controlled and uncontrolled studies, researchers found similar symptoms in those who had tested positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Children who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were slightly more likely to have some persistent symptoms.
The study suggests that long COVID might be less of a risk for young people than previously thought.

People who recover from COVID-19 often report persistent symptoms or long COVID.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , people can develop post-COVID conditions following SARS-CoV-2 infection even if they did not have COVID-19 symptoms.
Long-term effects may include fatigue , cognitive symptoms , and respiratory symptoms.
Many adults report long COVID symptoms.
However, there is conflicting data about the long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children.
Most children and young people (CYP) are either asymptomatic or have milder COVID-19 symptoms than adults, but some studies report long COVID in children .
A group of U.K. researchers has completed a systematic analysis of the literature on long COVID in CYP.
The study, which appears in the Journal of Infection, aimed to clarify whether persistent symptoms in young people are due to SARS-CoV-2 infection or the pressures of living in a pandemic.
Dr. Christopher Coleman, assistant professor of infection immunology at the University of Nottingham, U.K., told Medical News Today, “This is an important piece of research, as it attempts to pool all of the studies in this area — which should give a better conclusion than small studies.”
“Our findings suggest that persistent symptoms do occur in CYP after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but prevalence is much lower than originally suggested by many low-quality uncontrolled studies from early in the pandemic.”
– Dr. Olivia Swann, corresponding author and clinical lecturer in Paediatric Infectious Disease at the University of Edinburgh, U.K.
101 reported symptoms The researchers identified 3,357 studies, of which 22 met their criteria for analysis.
Participants had to be 19 years or under, with confirmed or probable SARS-CoV-2 infection, and experience symptoms beyond the acute illness.
The study analyzed data from 23,141 CYP in 12 countries, who were followed up for a median of 120 days.
The meta-analysis looked for evidence of many symptoms associated with long COVID.
Across all studies, a total of 101 wide-ranging symptoms was reported, including cognitive difficulties, loss of smell, headache, sore throat, fatigue, insomnia, and diarrhea.
The researchers assessed the prevalence, risk factors, type, and duration of long-term post-COVID symptoms.
“Most of these persistent symptoms were equally common in SARS-CoV-2 positive cases and SARS-CoV-2 negative controls.”
– Dr. Olivia Swann
Testing positive linked to more symptoms The studies in the analysis had some limitations.
All symptoms were self-reported by the participants, so could not be clinically verified.
Of the 22 studies, only five had a SARS-CoV-2 negative control group.
The authors regarded these as higher-quality studies, stressing the importance of a control group for avoiding bias.
Dr. Swann commented, “It’s important to note that the quality of published studies has been highly variable: Earlier studies without a control group paint a very different picture to more recent case-control studies, which are more reassuring.”
Speaking to MNT, Dr. Danelle Fisher, MD, FAAP (Fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics), chair of pediatrics at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, California, agreed, “There are limitations to this study but it is important to try to track the longevity of the symptoms and if possible compare it to control subjects, which has not yet been done.”
Those who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to have a few symptoms, such as cognitive difficulties, headache, loss of smell, sore throat, and sore eyes, than those who had not been infected.
“The meta-analysis showed a slight increase in children and young people who had symptoms after COVID-19 infection including cognitive difficulties, headaches, fatigue, and loss of smell.
These symptoms are also found after other related viral illnesses that are similar to COVID-19.”
– Dr. Danelle Fisher
Most people who get sick with COVID-19 recover in about two weeks, but for others the impact is far longer lasting.
No one knows exactly how many people end up with long COVID; estimates suggest that anywhere from 7.7 million to 23 million Americans might have it.
This wide range reflects that fact that there’s no universally accepted definition of long COVID, though the World Health Organization defines it as a condition that “occurs in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection, usually three months from the onset of COVID-19 with symptoms and that last for at least two months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis.”
What is clear is that an awfully large number of people are suffering with symptoms that linger or arise well after the virus should have cleared their system.
Shortness of breath, brain fog, fatigue, and an elevated heart rate or heart palpitations are among the most common problems, though insomnia, depression, dizziness, muscle pain, and digestive distress are also on the list, says Naomi Bauer, physical therapist and program director of the COVID-19 Recovery Program at WakeMed in Raleigh, N.C.
The extent of such symptoms also varies significantly.
Bauer herself has been dealing with long COVID since she contracted the virus nearly a year ago.
“I used to be a runner; now I can’t even walk fast.
I used to do 40-mile bike rides on weekends; now if I do that I’m on the couch the rest of the day,” she says.
Still, she describes her issues as mild to moderate, noting that some people with long COVID don’t have enough stamina to get out of bed, and others have developed serious heart or lung problems.
Given the wide range of symptoms and severity, there’s no one-size-fits-all fix.
What’s more, many people also have other health conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that worsened in the wake of COVID, says Monique Caruth, a Maryland-based physical therapist and spokesperson for the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA).
For these reasons, it’s wise to see your primary-care provider or a long COVID specialist before attempting to self-treat in any way.
Once a doctor has evaluated you, it may also be worth seeking out an evaluation from a physical therapist, who can devise a plan aimed to improve strength, mobility, endurance, and even certain breathing issues, says Brianne Mooney, an advanced clinician and physical therapist at Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) in New York.
“When addressing long COVID, a person must have a comprehensive management plan from their medical provider focusing on improving physical, mental, and social well-being,” she says.
For some patients, “physical therapy can be a vital part of that recovery plan.”
Ideally, physical therapy should be tailored to your specific issues.
(You can find a physical therapist near you or one that conducts telehealth visits at choosept.com.)
But if you prefer to go the DIY route or are waiting to snag an appointment, here are some physical therapy strategies that you can try at home to combat common long COVID symptoms.
Combat shortness of breath and anxiety
Two different breathing techniques may help.
To try pursed lip breathing, inhale slowly through your nose, then form a tight “o” shape with your lips and blow out forcefully through your mouth.
“Pretend you’re smelling roses or bacon cooking, then blowing out a birthday candle,” says Caruth.
“The long inhalation brings rich oxygen into the lungs, and then the exhale forces out carbon dioxide.”
Repeat five times.
Diaphragmatic breathing, also called belly breathing, is worth a try.
Place your hands on your stomach, breathe in through your nose for a count of four, pause for a count of two, then slowly out through your mouth for another count of six.
You should feel your stomach pushing against your hand as you inhale.
Repeat five to 10 times.
To support the muscles that assist in breathing, Mooney recommends scapular retraction: Sit tall and engage your core while your arms are outstretched in front of you or bent at your waist.
Pull your elbows toward your sides and squeeze your shoulder blades together.
Hold for five seconds, then slowly relax.
Repeat five to 10 times.
This exercise also helps promote better posture.
Improve balance
While holding onto a supportive surface (like furniture), try a single leg stance, suggests Mooney: Stand on one leg and try to maintain your balance, ideally holding for 15 to 30 seconds before putting your foot down and switching sides.
“As your balance improves, you may lessen the support of your hand on the surface in front of you,” she says.
Sit to stand is another technique that helps build balance.
Sit toward the edge of a chair, hold onto the armrest with both hands or just one hand, and then slowly stand up while maintaining good posture and engaging your leg muscles.
Repeat 10 to 15 times if you can.
Increase range of motion
If you’re not having any dizziness or shortness of breath
but you are feeling muscle tightness in your shoulders, back, hips, or thighs, Caruth suggests trying a chair forward fold: While seated (ideally in a stable chair without wheels) with feet flat on the floor, slowly bend forward and reach your hands down between your legs as you bend toward the floor or, if you can, under and toward the back of the chair.
You should feel this stretch—which is good for anyone who spends too much time hunched over a computer—in your lower back and shoulders.
Get up slowly to avoid dizziness; repeat about four times.
Build strength needed for daily activities
Seated knee extensions focus on the muscles needed for walking, stair climbing, sitting, and standing, says Mooney.
Start seated in a chair with knees bent and feet flat on the floor.
Slowly raise one foot and straighten your knee as you engage your thigh muscles.
Hold for a few seconds, then slowly lower your foot back to starting position.
Switch sides and repeat a few times.
Manage fatigue
Severe fatigue is one of the most common long COVID symptoms.
Slowly pushing yourself to build endurance—perhaps by walking a little further or doing other physical activity a little longer each day—works for some people with long COVID.
Others, however, have “post-exertional malaise” (also known as exercise intolerance), meaning that exercise makes them feel even more drained rather than energized.
Sometimes the impact isn’t apparent for several hours or even days after exercise, but keeping a diary or log can help you sort it out, says Bauer.
If you have exercise intolerance, you’re better off practicing energy conservation.
In short, this entails modifying what you’re doing throughout your day to save energy when possible.
“Find ways to save energy on your ‘have to do activities’ so you have more energy for your ‘want to do’ activities,” says Bauer.
For example, try sitting on a stool in the kitchen while cooking or using a robot vacuum (like a Roomba) to clean your floor, and you might find that you have a little extra energy to stay up and chat with your family after dinner.
“It is important to listen to your body,” says Mooney.
If any of the above strategies make you feel worse, stop and tell your health care provider.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Washington D.C.
Mayor Muriel Bowser said Thursday that she tested positive for COVID-19 and would “work at home while following isolation protocols.”
In a series of messages posted to Twitter, Bowser said she took an at-home test Wednesday after developing “cold-like” symptoms.
She later confirmed those positive results with a PCR test, which is more precise.
Bowser, 49, was elected Mayor in 2014 and will be running for a third term later this year.
Her older sister Mercia died of COVID-19 complications in February 2021 at the age of 64.

Bowser’s positive test comes amid a mini-outbreak in high-level Washington political circles following Saturday night’s Gridiron Club dinner.
More than a dozen guests who attended the A-list event — including two Cabinet members, journalists and multiple members of Congress — have tested positive this week.
Bowser’s office said she did not attend the Gridiron event.
Virus metrics in Washington have crept up in the past month according to the city health department.
The weekly case rate per 100,000 residents climbed from 51 at the beginning of March to 110 at the end of March.
But that’s still far below the weekly case rate of 865 per 100,000 residents reported in the second week of January during the omicron variant surge,
Bowser has lifted most of the District’s COVID restrictions, including mask and vaccine mandates in most indoor spaces.
Her last public event was a Tuesday evening conference sponsored by Axios.

Doctors are seeing an increasing number of patients with persistent skull pounding headaches, which they are now calling a long Covid-19 symptom.
Doctors say they are noticing worsening of pre-existing headaches and migraines.
"In some people, the impact of Covid-19 has been felt over a long duration, and these people experience moderate to severe intensity persistent daily headaches," said Dr Rakesh Lalla, consultant neurology, Fortis Hospital, Kalyan.
According to doctors, headache is one of the most common neurological symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, especially in young patients.
The possible causes can be attributed to the neuro-invasion of the virus, he said.
"Releases of cytokines like interleukins, and activation of the trigeminovascular system.
In addition, one cannot exclude the possibility of overuse of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs or NSAIDs leading to medication overuse, which is now causing headaches and migraines, along with rampant psychological stressors during the post-pandemic period," he added.
A latest survey by Saridon, the well known headache relief brand from Bayer's consumer health, revealed that 93% of respondents who experienced headaches witnessed a noticeable increase, directly linked to elevated stress levels, in a post-pandemic era.
Dr. (Col) Joy Dev Mukherji,vice chairman & head- neurology sciences, Neurology Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket, said headache has been a common symptom of Covid , with the alpha, delta and omicron variants.
"However, a headache that doesn't go away after having Covid-19 could be a sign that you're fighting post-Covid headache.
Headache is a common feature during acute illness, and it is not surprising since headache often accompanies many viral illnesses.
""Studies show that people with migraine are more prone to develop post-Covid headache when compared to those without a history of migraine.
Patients with a history of migraine also see an increase in migraine attacks after having Covid.
It has been found that patient's had an increase in attack frequency post Covid -19 infections...
So, Covid has certainly been reported to be associated with what we call migraine chronification or worsening of migraine," he added.
Public health officials in the state say a new strain of coronavirus known as XBB.1.16 may be linked to an uptick in pink eye cases.
Arizona Public Health Association executive director Will Humble said while pink eye has been noted as a symptom of prior virus strains, it hasn’t been as highly reported.
“The good news is with this strain it’s no more serious or lethal than any previous strains.
It does appear, anecdotally, to cause more pink eye, especially in kids,” he said.
Humble said the nickname of the new strain is Arcturus, named after the star.
He recommends getting children vaccinated or boosted as well as making sure they’re up-to-date on all their other shots.
There’s a lot to be jolly about this Christmas.
COVID has been significantly, although not completely, “defanged”, thanks to vaccines and treatments.
Christmas dos, nativity plays and New Years Eve parties are all back on the festive calendar.
However, the return to “normal” brings with it the return of high rates of all the other winter bugs that were kept at bay largely due to reduced socialising during the previous two winters.
Along with COVID, northern hemisphere countries including the US and the UK are currently seeing or have recently seen large increases in influenza, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) and the common cold.
Combined, these infections are leading to high numbers of hospital admissions and putting a strain on health systems.
A social distancing debt
Some have spoken of a lockdown-induced “immunity debt”.
This suggests a lack of exposure to seasonal viruses during the pandemic has inhibited our immune systems, leading to high rates of certain infectious diseases, especially among children.
This hypothesis is controversial because at this stage there’s not enough evidence to support it.
I would argue that if anything, we’re seeing a “social distancing debt”.
After two years of restrictions, UK data shows people have been mixing much more in the lead up to this Christmas compared with last year.
It stands to reason that as socialising bounces back, so do the bugs.
So what should you do if you find yourself with symptoms on Christmas day?

A cold or COVID?
In previous years, in many countries, there were laws, policies and guidance to follow around what to do if you were ill (although these were at times conflicting and confusing).
This year, it’s pretty much down to personal responsibility and “common sense”.
I have previously argued that there’s no such thing as common sense regarding COVID – none us have lived through a pandemic before and we’re learning as we go.
Certainly lockdowns and other stringent social distancing laws are, and should be, a thing of the past.
But people continue to need guidance.
There is still COVID-related guidance out there, for example from the World Health Organization.
Yet the challenge is knowing if you have COVID in the first place.
Part of the problem is how many COVID symptoms are common to other respiratory illnesses.
The symptoms of newer COVID variants are no longer as distinctive as they were with the original strain (for example, a “continuous cough” or a loss of taste or smell).
The most common COVID symptoms now include a sore throat, runny or blocked nose, and a cough without phlegm.
These are also common cold and flu symptoms.
In short, if in doubt, buy a COVID test.
Admittedly, this is easier said than done during a cost of living crisis (I would argue governments should try to make rapid tests free, at least during winters).
Testing is the only way to know for sure if your cough or sneeze is due to COVID.
That said, although COVID has been particularly devastating over the past few years, respiratory diseases as a whole are worth preventing where possible.
Taken together, COVID, flu and pneumonia still account for a significant proportion of all deaths in many countries, including the UK.
A hierarchy of protections
To keep ourselves and others safe this Christmas, we might draw on what I call a “hierarchy of protections”.
This takes inspiration from a model used to manage workplace safety, the “hierarchy of controls”.
The model outlines five levels of protecting against hazards in the workplace.
By substituting occupational hazards for respiratory viruses, we can use this model to guide our actions if we have symptoms – COVID or otherwise – at Christmas (or any time).
1.
Protection by elimination: The only sure-fire way of not spreading an airborne illness is by not coming into close contact with anyone while infectious.
But some people may not be able to self-isolate.
Perhaps they need to care for loved ones this holiday season, or can’t face the prospect of another Christmas alone.
2. Protection by substitution: If we can’t eliminate our contacts when we’re sick, we can at least strive to reduce them, especially those who are clinically vulnerable.
Meeting outdoors wherever possible is also a good idea.
Viruses are much less likely to spread at outdoor carol services or Christmas markets than indoor ones.
3. Engineering protections: If we can’t meet outdoors (it is winter after all), then we can at least try to keep indoor spaces well ventilated, for example by opening windows and buying portable HEPA air filters).
4. Administrative protections: Where we need to meet, meeting briefly and avoiding physical contact like hugs and handshakes when sick can help.
5.
Protection by PPE: In many countries, mask-wearing and even hand-hygiene practices have decreased considerably over the past year.
But these are particularly important when sick.
We can think of face masks like umbrellas, using them as and when needed.
Of course, some of these actions can be used in combination, and will depend on the context.

Doing what we reasonably can to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses may mean some personal sacrifices this Christmas if you’re one of the unlucky ones to be unwell.
But it will benefit your loved ones and public health more widely.
Patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, have reported a wide range of symptoms.
They can be mild or severe and usually appear within 2-4 days after exposure to the virus.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can include:
fever
muscle pain and body aches
cough
sore throat
headache
repeated shaking and chills
loss of taste or smell
shortness of breath
difficulty breathing
nausea, vomiting and diarrhea
A small number of patients will get worse instead of better.
This usually happens after 5-7 days of illness and these individuals experience more shortness of breath and worsening cough.
Patients who are elderly or have chronic health conditions may develop a severe form of pneumonia.
Some people are asymptomatic or have the virus and don’t get as sick.
It is important to wear a mask and practice social distancing, so as not to spread this disease.
It seems every few months new symptoms of Covid arise and some people are wondering whether sweating is correlated to the illness.
Variants like delta, omicron, beta, and gamma have developed new symptoms that are different from the alpha variant.
Unlike the original virus that circulated in 2020, omicron has less deadly symptoms but appears more cold-like making it harder to distinguish between Covid and other illnesses.
For people with minimal symptoms, there are various signs to look out for when determining if you have Covid or allergies, or a cold.

Although Covid does not present itself the same in every person, guidance from the CDC suggests anytime a person feels unwell for multiple days they should seek out a Covid test.
But many people who have battled the omicron variant of Covid have reported night sweats as a symptom, even without the presence of a fever.
Dr. John Torres, NBC News senior medical correspondent told TODAY, "people are reporting night sweats, which is a very strange symptom that they say they’re having" more so than the loss of taste or smell which was an original symptom of Covid.
According to a study conducted by doctors at the University of Medical Sciences in Kashan, Iran nearly half of patients studied experienced excessive sweating or night sweats as a symptom of Covid.
Although almost all patients who experienced night sweats also experienced other symptoms of Covid like runny nose, sneezing, coughing, headache, fever, or more.
If you or a loved one begin experiencing night sweats in addition to other cold-like symptoms get tested for Covid and contact your doctor.
Other illnesses are associated with night sweats such as anxiety, menopause, infections, and more.

Mental confusion, psychosis can be early symptoms of COVID-19
It has been observed in autopsies carried out on patients who have died from the infection and that it has been possible to isolate the virus from the cerebral tissue.
New research says that delirium, a state of acute mental confusion, accompanied by a fever could be an early symptom of COVID-19.
The virus that causes COVID-19 affects the human body in many different ways.
Other that respiratory distress, it also affects the organs and manifests itself on the skin too.
Many studies have linked it to neurological symptoms like confusion, temporary loss of memory and so on.
Now new research from Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) in Spain adds to the growing body of evidence that delirium, a state of acute mental confusion, accompanied by a fever could be an early symptom of COVID-19.
Delirium is an abrupt change in the brain that causes mental confusion and emotional disruption.
It makes it difficult to think, remember, sleep, pay attention, and more.
The study, published in the Journal of Clinical Immunology and Immunotherapy, highlights the fact that, together with the loss of the senses of taste and smell and headaches that occur in the days prior to the manifestation of coughing and breathing difficulties, some patients also develop delirium.
Neurocognitive alterations common in COVID-19
According to researchers, the manifestation of this state of confusion, when accompanied by high fever, should be considered an early marker of the disease, particularly in the case of elderly patients.
They also stressed that we need to be on the alert, particularly in an epidemiological situation like this, because an individual presenting certain signs of confusion may be an indication of infection.
For the results, the research team reviewed the body of scientific work published on the effects of COVID-19 in relation to the central nervous system, i.e. the brain.
The review found that, although the first cases of pneumonia were reported in China focused on the damage it causes to the lungs and other organs, such as the kidneys and heart, there are growing indications that the coronavirus also affects the central nervous system and produces neurocognitive alterations, such as headaches and delirium, as well as psychotic episodes.
Causes are COVID-19 induced hypoxia, inflammation
The main hypotheses which explain how the coronavirus affects the brain point to three possible causes: hypoxia or neuronal oxygen deficiency, inflammation of brain tissue due to cytokine storm and the fact that the virus has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier to directly invade the brain.
Any one of these three factors have the potential to result in delirium and explained that evidence of hypoxia-related brain damage.
Damage to hippocampus is another cause
It has been observed in autopsies carried out on patients who have died from the infection and that it has been possible to isolate the virus from the cerebral tissue.
According to the researchers, delirium, cognitive deficits and behavioural anomalies are most likely to be the result of systemic inflammation of the organ and a state of hypoxia.
It also causes the neuronal tissue to become inflamed and cause damage in areas such as the hippocampus, which are associated with the cognitive dysfunctions and behavioural alterations presented by patients suffering delirium.
Last month, another study, published in the journal Age and Ageing, revealed that delirium is a key symptom of COVID-19 in frail, older people.

Women are significantly more likely than men to experience long COVID, with symptoms that follow a distinct clinical pattern, researchers reported today.
They said more efforts are needed to explore sex differences in outcomes, including greater risks of exposure for some jobs.
The researchers from the Johnson & Johnson Office of the Chief Medical Officer reported their findings yesterday in Current Medical Research and Opinion, a peer-reviewed journal.
Patterns of short- and longer-term sequelae
The researchers examined academic papers on COVID that were published between Dec 2019 and Aug 2020, plus studies on long COVID that appeared between Jan 2020 and Jun 2021.
The total sample size included 1.3 million people, but the team pointed out that only 35 of 640,634 articles provided data by sex and enough details about clinical symptoms and outcome to make a gender comparison.
All of the 35 studies were conducted before COVID-19 vaccination was widely available.
Only 5 of the 35 studies addressed long COVID.
Authors looked at both sequelae, including symptoms that lasted less than 4 weeks after symptom onset and long COVID, defined as symptoms lasting more than 4 weeks after symptom onset.
For the shorter-term sequelae, females were more likely than males to experience issues related to mood; ear, nose, and throat; musculoskeletal; and respiratory problems.
Males were significantly more likely to experience renal problems.
For long COVID, females were more likely to experience the condition, with an odds ratio of 1.22 (95% confidence interval, 0.75 to 0.93).
Females presented with a variety of symptoms that can include ear, nose, and throat problems and mood disorders, as well as neurological, skin, gastrointestinal and rheumatologic, and fatigue symptoms.
In contrast, male patients were significantly more likely to experience endocrinological disorders such as diabetes and kidney disease.
Differences in immune function could drive sex differences in long COVID, the team wrote, noting that women mount a more robust and rapid response, which helps with initial infection but might increase vulnerability to prolonged autoimmune-related diseases.
Understudied long-term consequences
Sex differences in outcomes have been reported during earlier coronavirus outbreaks, so the differences the current study suggests aren't surprising, the group noted.
However, they said that most studies don't report granular data by sex, which provides insights that might impact treatment.
They urged researchers to share disaggregated data, even if it wasn't part of the trial's primary focus, so that other groups can explore differences between the sexes.
Also, they wrote that other factors may play a role and should be explored in greater depth, including a greater exposure risk by gender, such as in professions like nursing or teaching, and potential gender-based differences in access to care.
Since the new coronavirus was first reported in China in late December, the world has learned a great deal about the disease it causes, COVID-19, that has killed hundreds of thousands of people around the world.
Initial assumptions about the virus and COVID-19 have been overturned as case counts and deaths increase around the world.
Doctors know now that the coronavirus spreads easily from person to person, it can be spread by people who don't have any symptoms at all and children can also contract the illness.
COVID-19 has only been here for several months, and there is much more to learn about the pandemic disease.
Here's what we know so far.
Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak
What is a coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that can cause a range of symptoms including a runny nose, cough, sore throat and fever.
Some are mild, such as the common cold, while others are more likely to lead to pneumonia.
They're usually spread through direct contact with an infected person.
The coronavirus gets its name from the crown-like spikes on its surface, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
("Corona" is Latin for "crown.")
Including the virus that causes COVID-19, there are a total of seven coronaviruses that can infect humans, the CDC reported.
Other well-known coronaviruses include those that cause SARS and MERS.
COVID-19 stands for “coronavirus disease 2019,” the year it was discovered.
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?
According to the CDC, key symptoms to watch for include:
Fever
Cough
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Chills
Muscle pain
Sore throat
Loss of taste or smell
Gastrointestinal symptoms — including nausea, diarrhea and vomiting — may also occur but are less common.
Up to 80 percent of people who become infected don’t need to be hospitalized and may not even know they're sick.
But in severe cases, the illness can cause pneumonia, kidney damage and death, according to the World Health Organization.
Other complications, including blood clots, strokes and neurological problems, have also been reported.
For some people — including those who were not sick enough to be hospitalized — symptoms including fever and fatigue can linger for weeks.
Some people have experienced such long-lasting illness that they've turned to social media for help when they couldn't get answers from their doctors.
Who is most at risk?
By far, older adults — especially people over age 80 with underlying medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes or lung diseases — are most vulnerable to complications of the coronavirus.
Younger people, however, are still susceptible to severe complications from COVID-19.
A CDC report from March found that in a sampling of hospitalized patients, more than half were under 65, and 20 percent were in their 20s, 30s or early 40s.
Underlying medical conditions are also a factor: People with obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure are at greater risk for complications from the coronavirus, according to a large study of hospitalized patients.
Are children getting the coronavirus?
COVID-19 cases in children remain rare, and most of the time, the illness is mild.
It’s unclear why most children appear to be spared.
In rare cases, however, children with COVID-19 can become very ill, and several deaths have been reported.
Many that do get very sick have underlying medical conditions.
The coronavirus is also being linked to a rare and potentially deadly inflammatory condition that can occur in children several weeks after they were infected with the virus.
The condition, officially called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C, has been reported in several states in the U.S.
The condition resembles other inflammatory illnesses including Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome.
Symptoms include a fever of at least 100.4 degrees, evidence of inflammation in the body and hospitalization with problems in at least two organs, plus a positive COVID-19 test or exposure to a positive individual.
How does the coronavirus spread?
The coronavirus spreads through respiratory droplets when a sick person coughs, sneezes or speaks.
People within 6 feet of an infected individual are most at risk for inhaling these droplets.
The main way the virus spreads is through close contact with other people.
It's possible that the virus can also spread through contact with contaminated surfaces, but according to the CDC, this is not thought to be the main mode of transmission.
Still, it's recommended that people regularly clean and disinfect surfaces.
How long does it take for someone to get sick?
The coronavirus's incubation period — meaning the time it takes from a person being infected with the virus to when they start showing symptoms — appears to be anywhere from two to 14 days.
Though, the average amount of time it takes a person to show symptoms is about five days, according to the World Health Organization.
Can I spread the coronavirus if I don’t have symptoms?
Yes, a person can spread the coronavirus even when they do not have symptoms.
Sometimes, this type of transmission is referred to as “presymptomatic spread,” meaning that a person will go on to develop symptoms.
In other instances, known as “asymptomatic spread,” where an individual never develops symptoms but can still be contagious.
Asymptomatic spread could account for up to a quarter of transmissions of the virus, and according to the CDC, an estimated 35 percent of people infected are asymptomatic.
A study in the journal Nature, published in April, found that people with minor complaints — slight cough, headache, low-grade fever — are most contagious at the earliest stages of their illness, either right before their symptoms begin or within the first few days.
If I get the coronavirus and recover, am I immune?
It’s too early to say whether catching the coronavirus gives you immunity against catching the virus again.
Immunity depends on whether, after people get sick, they develop the antibodies needed to fight off the virus — and how long these antibodies last in the body.
Many researchers hypothesize that people will develop immunity to the virus, at least for some period of time, as was the case with two other coronaviruses, SARS and MERS.
Evidence from one study using rhesus macaques — monkeys that share a majority of their genes with humans — have shown that after a coronavirus infection, the macaques developed antibodies that protected them from getting sick again.
Evidence so far from antibody testing suggests people do develop antibodies after a coronavirus infection.
But it’s still unclear whether these antibodies are protective, and only time will tell how long they last in the body.
Can I get the coronavirus outside?
There's a growing consensus in the scientific community that the risk of getting the coronavirus outdoors is low.
Experts generally agree that it’s safe to spend time outdoors, provided that people follow social distancing guidelines and practice good hygiene.
Scientists think most coronavirus cases resulted from close contact with an infected person, particularly when in an enclosed space, such as in the home.
How can I protect myself from the coronavirus?
One of the simplest prevention measures a person can take is proper hand-washing.
The CDC recommends washing hands with soap and water before eating; after using the bathroom, blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing; and before and after caring for a sick friend or a family member.
The most effective way to clean hands is to wet them with clean water, then apply soap and scrub for at least 20 seconds, before rinsing and drying with a clean towel.
Soap helps lift germs from the surface of the skin, but it's the scrubbing that gets germs off hands.
Hand sanitizer is a good alternative, but it must have at least 60 percent alcohol to be effective, according to the CDC.
What else can I do besides washing my hands?
Perhaps the best way to prevent the spread of the coronavirus is to keep sick people separated from healthy people.
The concept, called social distancing, is illustrated in the myriad measures businesses, sports organizations, school systems and others have taken to cut down on large gatherings.
Many public events are canceled or postponed; students and employees are encouraged to do their work from home.
Otherwise, infectious disease experts recommend staying 6 feet away from others.
Should I wear a face mask?
People may have the coronavirus but not realize they are sick.
Wearing a cloth face covering over your nose and mouth helps prevent virus particles from spreading to others when you speak and breathe.
A face covering likely does not reduce your own chance of getting sick, but it helps protect others around you.
Beginning in April, the CDC recommended that individuals use cloth face coverings "in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain," such as grocery stores and pharmacies.
The guidance recommends people use fabric coverings, not surgical masks or specialized N95 masks, which should be reserved for health care providers.
Information about how to make masks at home is available online.
Is there a coronavirus vaccine?
There is currently no vaccine to prevent the coronavirus.
The earliest a vaccine could be available is 2021, 12 to 18 months after scientists started vaccine development.
If a vaccine is successfully produced in that time frame, it would be the fastest ever developed.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told NPR "it's conceivable" that a vaccine will be ready to deploy by December 2020 or January 2021.
A number of vaccines are in development, including several that have reached clinical trials, where the vaccines are studied in humans.
Moderna, a company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, plans on starting large phase 3 trials over the summer.
At the same time, drug developers are beginning to produce large amounts of the experimental vaccines, so that if they turn out to be successful, they’ll be ready to distribute.
Is there a coronavirus treatment?
So far, one treatment, called remdesivir, has received an emergency use authorization in the U.S. for people with COVID-19 who are severely ill.
Remdesivir is an antiviral drug originally developed to treat Ebola.
A study conducted by the National Institutes of Health found that hospitalized patients who received remdesivir were able to be discharged within 11 days, on average, compared to 15 days among people who received a placebo.
Still, the drug is not considered a cure, and further research is ongoing.
Other possible treatments are also being looked at in clinical trials, including anti-inflammatory drugs and so-called convalescent plasma, which is an antibody-rich blood product taken from a patient who has fully recovered from COVID-19.
In June, British researchers reported that another drug, a steroid called dexamethasone, was found to reduce deaths in the sickest COVID-19 patients.
Do disinfectants kill the coronavirus?
Yes, they can.
The CDC suggests that anyone exposed to an infected patient clean all "high-touch" surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables.
Cleaning agents can include a household disinfectant with a label that says "EPA-approved," according to the CDC.
A homemade version can be made, using 4 teaspoons of bleach to 1 quart of water.
Experts say that when you spray sanitizer or use sanitizing wipes, it's important to let the solution dry on the surface, rather than wiping it off.

As more and more Pennsylvanians escape from their domiciles to explore the great outdoors again, the Department of Health is advising nature lovers in the commonwealth to take precautions against ticks.
On Tuesday, Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine offered up some advice to outdoorsmen and women on the proper steps to prevent problems with ticks and Lyme disease, which can present symptoms similar to COVID-19.
“Over the past several months, we have seen an increase in the number of emergency department visits related to tick bites,” Levine said.
“Some symptoms of Lyme disease, such as fever, chills and headache, are similar to symptoms of COVID-19.
It is essential that all residents know the proper ways to protect themselves against ticks and are aware of the dangerous diseases they can carry.
We want all Pennsylvanians to get outside and be healthy but do so in the safest way possible.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States, and is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, and rarely, Borrelia mayonii.
Common symptoms tend to include fever, chills, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, swollen lymph nodes, and a distinct skin rash called erythema migrans.
If left untreated, an infection can spread to joints, the heart and the nervous symptom.
While anyone who ventures outside is at risk of getting a tick – especially in wooded and bushy areas, areas with high grass and leaf litter, and even back yards – there are some precautions that can be taken to decrease the chances for bites.
The Department of Health advises that people should walk in the center of trails and avoid areas with high grass and leaf litter; use a repellant that contains at least 20% DEET; wear light-colored clothing; conduct full-body checks on yourself and your pets after spending time outside; and take a bath or shower within two hours after coming indoors.
If you have been bitten by a tick, it is important to monitor the area for symptoms —particularly a red, swollen bulls-eye-shaped rash — and contact a heath care provider immediately.
Symptoms may present in as few as two or as many as 30 days after exposure.
Later-stage symptoms, which may present upwards of months after exposure, can include arthritis, heart and neurological issues.
While some patients with Lyme disease experience few to no symptoms, others may become severely ill and may even die.
According to the Department of Health, more than 8,500 cases of Lyme disease were reported across the commonwealth in 2019.
The actual total may be greater, as the department is still working to compile Lyme disease data, which should be made available within the month.
Over at East Stroudsburg University, the Dr. Jane Huffman Wildlife Genetics Institute offers free tick diagnostic testing.
According to the institute’s website, lab technicians use microscopy to identify the tick species, life stage, sex, engorgement measurement, and 17 different pathogens that can present in the Blacklegged or Deer Tick, the Lonestar Tick and the American Dog Tick.
Testing occurs in a three-step process, and can be completed within three days.
Those interested in having a tick tested can find information on the Tick Research Lab of Pennsylvania website.
Ticks can be mailed in or dropped off at the Dr. Jane Huffman Wildlife Genetics Institute.
According to the lab’s analysis, out of the 19,564 ticks they have tested in the commonwealth, 7,183 were infected, and 12,381 were uninfected.
About 32% of Deer Ticks tested positive for Lyme disease.
LONDON (THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) -
Sore throat is the most common symptom if someone has developed Covid-19, followed by headache and blocked nose, said a British study.
Earlier pandemic symptoms such as fever and loss of taste and smell were now the least reported symptoms of Covid-19, the Zoe Covid-19 Study reported, using data released as at July 11.
The study conducted by the health science company also lists cough, hoarse voice, sneezing, fatigue and muscle aches as common symptoms now.
Dr Tim Spector, co-founder of Zoe and lead scientist for the study, also said the virus was still rampant in the population in Britain.
"So much so that if you have any cold-like symptoms at the moment, it is nearly twice as likely to be Covid-19 than a cold," he said.
"This is because there are various Covid-19 variants co-existing, such as Omicron variants BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5.
Even people with past infections or who are fully vaccinated can contract it.
"
Dr David Nabarro, who is the World Health Organisation's special envoy on the virus, has also said it was constantly evolving and becoming "too clever".
"This virus is capable of constantly evolving and changing, which is why we have seen an increase in cases as it has changed yet again, becoming too clever for us.
"It can break past our immune defences and that is why the numbers are going up," added Dr Nabarro in an interview with Sky News.
As a science journalist, I’ve read dozens of research papers about Covid-19, and I’ve interviewed so many virologists, infectious disease physicians and immunologists over the past two years that I’ve lost count.
But nothing prepared me for what happened after my 7-year-old daughter tested positive for Covid-19 nearly two weeks ago.
It started the way you might expect: On a Sunday evening, my daughter spiked a fever.
The next morning, we got an email informing us that she’d been exposed to the coronavirus on Friday at school.
I gave her a rapid antigen test, which quickly lit up positive.
I resigned myself to the possibility that the whole family was, finally, going to get Covid-19.
But we didn’t — not exactly.
I, for one, never developed symptoms or tested positive.
On the day my daughter first tested positive, my 11-year-old son announced that he wasn’t feeling well and began developing classic coronavirus symptoms: headache, fatigue, sore throat, runny nose.
My husband followed two days later with a sore throat and stuffy nose.
Yet despite testing daily for seven days straight, my husband and son never tested positive for Covid-19 — including on PCR tests administered on my son’s fifth day of symptoms, and my husband’s third.
(And yes, we did some throat swabs, too.)
We racked our brains as to what might have happened: Did my husband and son get Covid, even though they never tested positive?
Or did they have another virus that caused identical symptoms and happened to infect them right after they were exposed to Covid-19?
(Our pediatrician said that was unlikely.)
Why hadn’t I gotten sick at all?
I called experts in immunology, microbiology and virology to get their take.
Minister of Health Terawan Agus Putranto has issued Decree of Minister of Health number HK.01.07/MENKES/413/2020 on Guidelines for Prevention and Control of COVID-19.
The Decree introduces several terms in COVID-19 handling.
The terms include “probable” which refers to the suspect with severe acute respiratory infections (ARI) or respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or those who died with a convincing clinical symptom of COVID-19 without any laboratory examination result of rapid test or PCR test.
The Decree also changes the existing terms of person under observation (ODP), patients under surveillance (PDP), and asymptomatic carriers (OTG) to “suspect case”, “confirmed case” (symptomatic and asymptomatic), and “close contact”.
The suspect case refers to a person who has one of the following criteria: A person with acute respiratory infections (ARI) and in the last 14 days before the symptom occurrence has a history of travel or living in a country/region of Indonesia that reports local transmission.
A person with one of the symptoms of the ARI, and in the last 14 days before symptom occurrence has a history of contact with a confirmed/probable COVID-19 case.
A person with severe ARI/pneumonia who needs treatment in hospital and having no other cause based on a convincing clinical symptom.
The confirmed case is a person who tests positive for the COVID-19 based on rapid test-PCR test.
The confirmed case is divided into two, namely the confirmed cases with symptoms (symptomatic), and the confirmed cases without symptoms (asymptomatic).
The close contact is a person who has a history of contact with a COVID-19 probable case or confirmed case.
The aforementioned contact history includes: Face to face contact/proximity to probable cases or confirmed cases within a radius of 1 meter and within a period of 15 minutes or more.
Direct physical touch with probable or confirmed cases (including shaking hands, holding hands, etc.)
A person who provides direct treatment for probable cases or confirmed cases without using standardized personal protective equipment.
Other situations that indicate the contact, based on local risk assessments determined by the local epidemiological investigation team (the explanation is attached).
In symptomatic probable or confirmed case, the close contact period is determined from 2 days before the case occurrence and up to 14 days after the case symptoms occurrence.
In asymptomatic confirmed case, the close contact period is determined from 2 days before and 14 days after the date of specimen collection of the confirmed case.
In addition to the terms, the Decree also includes other terms, including traveler, discarded, complete isolation, and death.
A traveler is a person who has traveled domestically or abroad in the last 14 days.
Discarded refers to one of the following criteria:
A person with suspect status with 2 time negative rapid test-PCR test results for 2 consecutive days with an interval of >24 hours.
A person with close contact status who has completed the quarantine period of 14 days.
Complete Isolation refers to the patient who meets one of the following criteria:
Asymptomatic confirmed cases without rapid test-PCR test follow-up with additional 10 days of self- isolation since the specimen is taken.
Probable cases/confirmed cases with symptoms (symptomatic) without rapid test-PCR test follow-up after 10 days from the date of symptom occurrence plus at least 3 days after symptom disappearance of fever and respiratory problems.
Probable cases/confirmed cases with symptoms (symptomatic) with a negative rapid test-PCR test follow-up, plus at least 3 days after not showing symptoms of fever and respiratory problems.

On August 3, 2020, this report was posted online as an MMWR Early Release.
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is spread from person to person (1–3).
Quarantine of exposed persons (contacts) for 14 days following their exposure reduces transmission (4–7).
Contact tracing provides an opportunity to identify contacts, inform them of quarantine recommendations, and monitor their symptoms to promptly identify secondary COVID-19 cases (7,8).
On March 12, 2020, Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Maine CDC) identified the first case of COVID-19 in the state.
Because of resource constraints, including staffing, Maine CDC could not consistently monitor contacts, and automated technological solutions for monitoring contacts were explored.
On May 14, 2020, Maine CDC began enrolling contacts of patients with reported COVID-19 into Sara Alert (MITRE Corporation, 2020),* an automated, web-based, symptom monitoring tool.
After initial communication with Maine CDC staff members, enrolled contacts automatically received daily symptom questionnaires via their choice of e-mailed weblink, text message, texted weblink, or telephone call until completion of their quarantine.
Epidemiologic investigations were conducted for enrollees who reported symptoms or received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result.
During May 14–June 26, Maine CDC enrolled 1,622 contacts of 614 COVID-19 patients; 190 (11.7%) eventually developed COVID-19, highlighting the importance of identifying, quarantining, and monitoring contacts of COVID-19 patients to limit spread.
In Maine, symptom monitoring was not feasible without the use of an automated symptom monitoring tool.
Using a tool that permitted enrollees to specify a method of symptom monitoring was well received, because the majority of persons monitored (96.4%) agreed to report using this system.
Public health investigators interviewed persons with COVID-19 upon report of the case to Maine CDC to collect information about their contacts, including date of last exposure.
Contacts were defined as persons who were within 6 feet of an infectious person† for ≥15 minutes (≥30 minutes before May 29).
Data were stored in the National Electronic Disease Surveillance Base System (NBS)§ and sent to Maine CDC’s contact tracing team within 24 hours, along with contact data reported to Maine CDC by other jurisdictions and CDC’s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine.
The contact tracing team telephoned contacts to provide quarantine recommendations,¶ enroll them in Sara Alert, and instruct them to report symptoms daily via the Sara Alert questionnaire for the remainder of their quarantine.
If contacts refused automated monitoring or could not be enrolled because of language barriers, they would be monitored using direct monitoring.
Per the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists’ case definition,** monitored signs and symptoms included cough, difficulty breathing, fever, chills, shaking with chills (rigors), muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and new loss of taste or smell.
The contact tracing team attempted to directly monitor contacts who refused or were unable to be enrolled.
Maine CDC staff members conducted case investigations for all enrollees who sought SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing and had a positive result (confirmed cases) irrespective of symptoms and those who did not have molecular testing but reported symptoms (probable cases).
Staff members attempted to call or text enrollees who did not respond to the questionnaire within 24 hours.
Enrollees who did not report symptoms during their quarantine period were automatically released from quarantine by a Sara Alert–issued notice.
Data for contacts enrolled during May 14–June 26, 2020, were extracted from Sara Alert.
Enrollee demographic characteristics and Sara Alert program preferences, selected by enrollees at the time of enrollment, were analyzed, and the number of persons enrolled per household were calculated based on self-reported address.
All persons enrolled in Sara Alert during the study period were matched to NBS records using date of birth and the first initial of their first and last names.
NBS data were extracted on July 10 to allow contacts enrolled by June 26 to complete 14 days of quarantine.
Data extracted from NBS included case status (confirmed or probable), hospitalization status, and outcome, including death.
For most analyses, confirmed and probable cases were combined.
SAS (version 9.3; SAS Institute) was used to conduct analyses.
This activity was determined to meet the requirements of public health surveillance as defined in 45 CFR 46.102(l)(2).
During May 14–June 26, 2020, Maine enrolled 1,622 contacts (enrollees) of 614 COVID-19 patients in Sara Alert.
The average number of enrollees per index patient was 2.9 (range = 0–31).
Among enrollees, median age was 29 years (range = 0–93 years); 766 (50.3%) were female (Table 1).
Race data were available for 1,240 (76.4%) enrollees, 732 (59.0%) of whom identified as white and 486 (39.2%) as black/African American.
Ethnicity data were available for 1,020 (62.9%) enrollees, 42 (4.1%) of whom identified as Hispanic/Latino.
Primary language was documented for 1,230 (75.8%) enrollees; 985 (80.1%) primarily spoke English, 86 (7.0%)
French, and 81 (6.6%) Somali.
Overall, 475 (29.3%) of 1,622 enrollees were enrolled within 2 days of their last exposure to the patient (Table 2), including 153 (9.5%) enrolled the day of their last exposure, likely indicating ongoing exposure.
Among enrollees, 1,564 (96.4%) agreed to be monitored using the automated symptom monitoring, whereas 58 (3.6%) required direct monitoring.
Enrollees using automated symptom monitoring preferred text message (976; 60.2%), followed by texted weblink (342; 21.1%), telephone call (127; 7.8%), and e-mailed weblink (119; 7.3%).
Most enrollees (870; 59.0%) preferred an evening contact time.
Among all enrollees, 231 (14.2%) reported symptoms or had a positive test result.
Among these enrollees, 41 (17.7%) were determined not to have COVID-19, including 24 who received negative test results and 17 whose symptoms did not meet those specified by the case definition; these 41 enrollees were reenrolled in Sara Alert for the remainder of their quarantine.
Among all enrollees, 190 (11.7%) met the COVID-19 case definition.
Among these 190 persons, 127 (66.8%) were confirmed to have COVID-19, and 63 (33.2%) were considered to have probable cases (Table 3).
Among all persons with probable and confirmed cases, median age was 32 years (range = 0–93 years); 99 (52.1%) were female.
Race data were available for 186 (97.9%) patients, among whom 98 (52.7%) identified as white and 81 (43.5%) as black/African American.
Ethnicity was available for 182 (95.8%) patients, six (3.3%) of whom identified as Hispanic/Latino.
Exposure was self-reported for 165 (86.8%) patients; household exposure was most common (112; 67.9%).
COVID-19 symptoms were reported for 136 (74.3%) patients.
Four (2.1%)
patients were hospitalized, and one (0.5%) died.
During May 14–July 10, Maine reported 1,869 total COVID-19 cases††; thus, approximately 10% of Maine’s COVID-19 patients were identified among Sara Alert enrollees.

Some Americans who take Paxlovid, an antiviral for Covid-19, may see their symptoms rebound following a brief recovery, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an advisory on Tuesday.
The Food and Drug Administration authorized Paxlovid for emergency use in December for people ages 12 and up who have mild or moderate Covid but are at high risk of a severe case.
That includes older Americans, people with obesity, those who smoke or are pregnant and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, HIV or cancer.
The drug regimen consists of three pills taken twice daily for five days.
But two to eight days after completing the treatment and receiving a negative test, some patients may test positive again and see their symptoms reappear, the CDC said.
The advisory affirmed a trend many patients and doctors have been discussing for at least a month.
A case study posted online in late April sequenced virus samples from a 71-year-old man who saw his illness rebound after finishing Paxlovid.
The study, which is under review by a medical journal, found no indication that the man had developed resistance to the drug; instead, the authors suggested that symptoms may recur “before natural immunity is sufficient to fully clear” the virus.
More recently, three prominent doctors have documented so-called Paxlovid rebounds within their own households on Twitter.
Dr. Bob Wachter, chair of the University of California, San Francisco's Department of Medicine, chronicled the case of his wife, Katie Hafner.
"While rebound cases seem to be mild & self-limited, rebound is still a big bummer," he wrote on Tuesday.
"Katie was forced back into isolation for an extra week or so, her symptoms worsened … & she could have infected someone (incl. me!)
had she not been uber-careful.
"
Dr. Tatiana Prowell, an associate professor of oncology at Johns Hopkins, and Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, offered similar anecdotes.
"Day 22 since onset.
Still symptomatic.
Rapid test still very pos.
What do we do?
There’s no guidance.
We’re 2 drs, & we don’t know," Prowell tweeted on Monday.
"Either this post-Paxlovid relapse is real, something unique to BA.2.12 (although can’t confirm)…or something ...
We’ll eventually figure this out, but still a puzzle," Hotez wrote last week, referring to an omicron subvariant that is now the predominant strain in the U.S.
All three experts said, however, that rebounds don't necessarily mean Paxlovid doesn't work.
Pfizer's clinical trial showed that Paxlovid lowered the risk of hospitalization or death among high-risk Covid patients by 88 percent within five days of symptom onset.
The National Institutes of Health still recommends it over other treatments for mild or moderate Covid.
Plus, the CDC has not thus far identified any cases of severe disease among people whose symptoms or infection rebounded after taking Paxlovid.
On average, patients whose symptoms returned or who tested positive again saw those second-round illnesses improve or resolve with three days.
They didn't require additional treatments, the CDC said.
The agency did recommend, however, that people with Covid rebounds start their isolation over.
The CDC has not yet determined if patients with Covid rebounds are more or less likely to spread the virus than they were during their initial illness.
“A brief return of symptoms may be part of the natural history” of coronavirus infections for some people, regardless of whether they took Paxlovid or were vaccinated or boosted, the CDC said.
Pfizer’s clinical trial identified similar rates of Covid rebounds among participants who recently finished Paxlovid and those who recently got a placebo.
Paxlovid must be taken within five days after someone gets diagnosed with Covid.﻿ Some medical experts, including Wachter, have mused about whether patients would benefit from a longer treatment course.
Other experts have wondered whether Paxlovid is being administered too early in the course of an illness.
At the least, the CDC said, cases of Covid rebound don't appear to be related to reinfection.
In a recent study posted to the medRxiv* pre-print server, Austrian researchers performed a multi-cohort analysis to investigate the slow resolution of subjective olfactory dysfunction (OD) and accompanying taste disorder in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) inpatients and outpatients.

Background
*Important notice: medRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.
The medical community has coarsely defined COVID-19-related persistent symptoms; however, these definitions do not characterize these symptoms.
The characterization of COVID-19 recovery patterns, persistent symptoms, including OD and taste disorders, and their burden, are crucial to identifying at-risk patients who may benefit from targeted remedial therapies.
COVID-19-related OD occurs due to injured upper respiratory epithelial cells or neurons of the olfactory bulb, mucosa, or primary olfactory cortex and is estimated to affect up to 48% of patients during acute COVID-19.
Note that the patients infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) wild type (wt), Alpha, and Delta variants more commonly suffer from OD.
There is data evidence that OD resolves within two to three weeks in most patients but may persist up to six months in five to 11% of patients; therefore, classified as post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC).
Although this condition does not pose problems for all the patients, it affects the quality of life (QoL) due to its disabling character in some patients.
About the study
In the present study, researchers investigated the recovery trajectory, including clinical and psychosocial recovery of COVID-19 patients focusing primarily on OD.
To this end, they re-analyzed the observations and results of a published survey of non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients and another multi-center study that had both ambulatory and hospitalized patients using association mining and clustering algorithms.
The ambulatory COVID-19 convalescents in Tyrol, Austria (AT), and South Tyrol, Italy (IT) participated in the Health after COVID-19 in Tyrol (HACT) online survey between 30 September 2020 and 5 July 2021.
During this time, the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant dominated these regions along with the wt strain.
Additionally, the team included patients with symptomatic COVID-19, with more than 90 days gap between diagnosis and survey completion in the analysis.
They asked the participants to assign 42 symptoms to pre-defined duration classes as acute, long COVID, and PASC.
They surveyed self-perceived complete recovery, need for rehabilitation, and drugs since COVID-19 as yes or no items.
The researchers used the partitioning around medoids (PAM) algorithm to cluster the training HACT AT cohort by symptom-specific recovery times and the five-nearest neighbor's classification algorithm to assign the IT cohort participants to the AT cohort-defined clusters.
The other study termed CovILD included both COVID-19 outpatients and inpatients recruited in Austria between March and June 2020.
The team prospectively recorded eight symptoms, including reduced physical activity, hyposmia or anosmia, dyspnea, sleep problems, fever, cough, night sweating, and gastrointestinal symptoms on days 60-, 100-, 180- and 360 after COVID-19.
They used the 16-item Sniffin' Sticks identification test to assess objective OD at the 100- and 360-day follow-up.

Study findings
Self-perceived OD was a common acute symptom among 47 to 75% of ambulatory patients and 33 to 53% of patients suffering from moderate-to-severe COVID-19.
Interestingly, taste disorders accompanied its slow-pace recovery in these patients.
Convalescents with persistent OD were predominantly young females with only a few pre-existing chronic conditions; who enjoyed good mental and physical health.
Consequently, female patients with OD may best benefit from early neurological assessment for timely initiation of therapy.
Moreover, the first four weeks of being convalescent halved the percentages of self-perceived OD; however, every sixth moderately ill COVID-19 patient of the CovILD cohort reported persistent OD at the one-year study follow-up.
Clustering of ambulatory COVID-19 individuals by symptom-specific recovery times.
Individuals of the training Austria (AT) cohort of the HACT study were subjected to clustering in respect to symptom-specific recovery times with the PAM (partitioning around medoids) algorithm and Euclidean distance measure (Supplementary Figure S8).
Cluster assignment in the test Italy (IT) HACT cohort was done with k-NN label propagation algorithm.
Recovery times for particular COVID-19 symptoms in the COVID-19 recovery clusters are presented as heat maps.
Numbers of individuals assigned to the recovery clusters are indicated under the plots.
Dim.: diminished, Imp.: impaired, FMS: fine motor skills.
The researchers used questionnaires specifically addressing OD-related QoL measures.
Adopting a different methodology might have resulted in discrepant results.
Accordingly, persistent OD affected a subset of patients with no other clinical, physical, or mental health issues.
The study showed a unique OD recovery kinetics with fast resolution within the first few weeks, followed by a plateau.
Therefore, it is unknown whether post-COVID-19 OD resolves in all patients.
Since complete OD resolution might require months to years, it might have left millions of COVID-19 convalescents worldwide with residual OD.
Hence, there is an immediate need to develop novel therapeutics to treat this condition.
Studies have demonstrated that olfactory training may significantly amend OD in patients with COVID-19 and traumatic brain injury (TBI).
Interestingly, COVID-19-independent objective OD prevalence is as high as 29% in the general population.
Therefore, presumably, the CovILD cohort had a higher objective OD rate than self-perceived hyposmia.
Further research is needed to elucidate the observed underestimates of the objective OD frequency during long-term COVID-19 recovery.
Conclusions
The study identified OD, taste disorders, tiredness, fatigue, and neurocognitive symptoms as the top clinical manifestations of long COVID and PASC.
Of these symptoms, persistent smell and taste disorders, which also reflected an impaired retronasal smell, qualified as a distinct phenotype of long COVID and PASC.
However, the overlap of OD and taste disorders with other persistent symptoms was lesser, especially 90 days after COVID-19 onset.
To conclude, the observed OD phenotype characterized by the absence of physical or mental health deficits stressed the heterogeneity of PASC.
Nevertheless, there is a continuous need for phenotyping of COVID-19-related OD as new SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge.

In early March, before we really knew what we were dealing with in regards to COVID, Gwyneth Paltrow posted a photo of herself on a plane to Paris wearing a mask.
"Paranoid?

she wrote in the caption.
"[I'm] just going to go ahead and sleep with this thing on the plane.

Paltrow starred in the 2011 movie Contagion, which gained newfound attention early in the pandemic for its uncanny similarities to what we've all been experiencing over the past 12 months.
Nearly a year after Paltrow posted that Instagram, we know a whole lot more about COVID and Paltrow even has firsthand experience.
She shared a post on her website, Goop, on Feb. 17, revealing she had COVID-19 "early on" in the pandemic.

Fatigue
"I had COVID-19 early on, and it left me with some long-tail fatigue," Paltrow wrote on Goop.
She didn't go into much detail in the post, but it's become clear that fatigue is the most common symptom for those who experience the long effects of COVID after the virus has left their bodies.
A survey by Survivor Corps—a long COVID support group—led by Natalie Lambert, PhD, of the Indiana University School of Medicine, polled 1,500 COVID long-haulers.
They found that 100 percent of respondents reported feeling fatigue.

Brain fog
Brain fog is another symptom that Paltrow reported experiencing, which is also common among long-term COVID sufferers.
White House COVID adviser Anthony Fauci, MD, recently explained in an interview with the Duke Global Health Institute that brain fog refers to the feeling of having "a difficulty in focusing or concentrating."
According to the Survivor Corps report, 59 percent of COVID long-haulers said they experienced difficulty concentrating, like Paltrow.

Inflammation
Paltrow also said that she's been dealing with inflammation.
"In January, I had some tests done that showed really high levels of inflammation in my body," she wrote.
While she didn't explain exactly where the inflammation was, this long-term effect of COVID is one that's caused medical professionals some concern, particularly when it comes to the heart and the brain.
For example, a JAMA Cardiology study published in July looked at cardiac MRIs of 100 people who had recovered from COVID-19 within the past two to three months.
They found "ongoing myocardial inflammation" in 60 percent of the study participants.
Additionally, a June study published in the journal Radiology found that 68 percent of severe COVID patients had "increased markers of inflammation" in their brains.

Paltrow has adjusted her diet in an effort to improve her health post-COVID.
Paltrow said that she saw functional medicine practitioner Will Cole, a doctor of natural medicine, and is using a keto and semi-plant-based intermittent fasting diet from his book.
"After he saw all my labs, he explained that this was a case where the road to healing was going to be longer than usual," Paltrow wrote.
She went on to talk about the supplements she's taking, the non-alcoholic cocktail she enjoys, and some of her favorite skincare products.

Troy and Melody Randle.
Her insistence that he go to the hospital to be treated for splitting headaches led to the discovery of his stroke, and may have saved his life.

After five days, the worst of the COVID-19 symptoms — the headache, the fever, the body ache — had ended.
But it was only the start of the medical crisis for Troy L. Randle, a New Jersey cardiologist who is recovering from a devastating coronavirus consequence that doctors are only now learning about.
In mid-April, shortly after he was declared safe to go back to work treating patients in the Virtua Health System, Randle’s headache returned, more vicious than the last time.

“It felt like a sharp pain in the back of my head, and then I felt this intense pressure in the front,” the Mullica Hill man said.
“It felt like a vise.”
Randle, 49, tried to wait it out at home.
But after days of relentless pain, his wife, Melody, a nurse practitioner, broke into tears begging him to go to the hospital, where he had a CT scan and an MRI.
“I was totally blown away when they said I had a stroke,” Randle said.
Though it’s still fairly unusual, more people Randle’s age and younger appear to have suffered strokes as a result of infection with the coronavirus.
The connections between the virus and strokes are just beginning to be understood, but seem related to blood clots that form at a shockingly high rate in certain patients.
Clots cause strokes when they block blood flow to the brain, and in COVID-19 patients, these strokes may be especially dangerous and hard to treat.
“Those clots are stubborn clots — they are difficult, stubborn clots to be removed,” said Pascal M. Jabbour, a Thomas Jefferson University Hospital physician and head of the neurovascular division who recently reported on coronavirus-positive stroke patients he treated.
“The outcome was worse.”
» READ MORE: A mysterious blood-clotting complication is killing coronavirus patients
The article he coauthored, now under review by a medical journal, describes 12 stroke patients treated at Jefferson hospitals and NYU Langone Health in New York City between March 20 and April 10, who were positive for COVID-19.
Some of the patients had no virus symptoms before their strokes.
They were also much younger — 40% were under age 50 — than most stroke patients, who typically are in their 70s, Jabbour said.
Overall, Jabbour said, 35% of stroke patients at the two health systems were COVID-positive, an unusually high rate of infection.
His observations are similar to those reported in the New England Journal of Medicine by doctors at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, who treated five stroke victims, all under age 50.
All tested positive for COVID-19.
“Even patients diagnosed with COVID but not sick with COVID, we need to keep an eye on those patients,” Jabbour said.
“Those patients are at risk of stroke, and they need to be watched very carefully.”
Data from China suggest up to 3% of COVID-positive people could suffer a stroke, said Erol Veznedaroglu, director of the Global Neurosciences Institute, based at Crozer-Chester Medical Center in Upland.
In the United States, more than a million people have tested positive for COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meaning at least 30,000 people could be at risk of stroke.
The type of stroke Randle had could have been fatal, said Veznedaroglu, who did not treat the cardiologist.
His vertebral artery had clotted, cutting off blood to the cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls balance and motor functions.
“It’s basically our life center to the brain,” Veznedaroglu said of the artery that was clogged.
‘You’ve already been exposed.’
At the outset of the pandemic, Randle thought that risking infection was part of his job, though he was worried about passing on the virus to his wife and six children.
“I got into medicine because I wanted to take care of people,” he said.
“That drive to take care of others and be there for others overrode any fear I had of catching the virus.”
He doesn’t think he contracted COVID-19 from a patient.
He shared a small reading room with another doctor who tested positive, and believes their proximity led to his illness.
The initial sickness was difficult, he said, and the weakness that accompanied it was overwhelming.
But the headaches were treatable with over-the-counter painkillers and the coughing was never too terrible.
When he returned to work, his colleagues joked that he no longer needed the protective gear medical workers wear when treating COVID-19 patients due the antibodies people who recover from the illness are believed to have.
“I don’t think you need all that,” one said.
“You’ve already been exposed.
"
‘I prayed and I cried’
He briefly experienced weakness in his right arm, he said, that he passed off as a lingering symptom of his illness.
The headaches that followed, though, were brutal and inexplicable.
He contemplated the possibility that he would not recover.
“I was lying in bed not knowing what was going on, not feeling well, and I didn’t want to break down in front of my family,” he said.
"So I grabbed a mask and I went for a walk in the neighborhood, and I prayed and I cried, because I knew something was wrong with me.”
His wife’s pleading finally got him to seek help.
“Potentially she saved my life, kind of insisting on that,” he said.
He believes the clot that caused his stroke likely formed during his initial illness.
The clots are the subject of intense study and some mystery.
They seem be related to inflammation and an extreme immune system response, called a cytokine storm, that some COVID-19 patients experience.
At issue, said Veznedaroglu, may be ACE2, a protein receptor present in the endothelium, a thin layer of tissue that lines blood vessels and the interior of the lungs.
This protein appears to be the coronavirus’ entry point into the body, through which it passes its genetic material into cells and begins replicating itself.
The virus’ links to ACE2 receptors may cause the endothelium, typically smooth to allow easy blood flow, to become inflamed.
Clots form under normal circumstances to repair damage, but the response itself appears to be damaging, with clotting severe enough to inhibit blood flow throughout the body.
“Some other patients ended up dying from further strokes,” Jabbour said.
“They kept on clogging.”
Clots can also cause heart attacks or pulmonary embolisms, which have also been associated with COVID-related causes of death, the Washington Post has reported.
Some people appear to have ACE2 (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptors that are more accessible to the coronavirus, which could explain why some experience significant clotting and others don’t, Veznedaroglu said.
Doctors treated Randle’s stroke with blood thinners and a cholesterol-lowering medication.
The headaches subsided, and the stroke’s damage appears to be limited to some dizziness when he moves his head quickly.
“When you think of the disability rate and mortality rate of people who have strokes," Randle said, "I’m tremendously blessed that I’m still functional.”
It is unclear whether people should be taking blood thinners as a preventative measure if they have mild symptoms of the virus.
“I think it’s still too early to give recommendations,” Jabbour said.
“Blood thinners have some risks.”

Fearing coronavirus at hospitals, patients with heart attacks or strokes may be staying away, doctors say
Anyone with stroke-like symptoms — such as sudden numbness in the face or arms, blurred vision, slurred speech, or severe headache — should seek treatment at a hospital immediately, doctors said.
“If you have any signs or symptom of a stroke, please, please, please go to the emergency room,” Veznedaroglu said.
“We can reverse the effects of stroke if we can get to patients in time.”
Remaining as active as possible is a way to reduce the chances of serious clotting, he said, speculating that shutdown orders might be making people more sedentary.
Smoking, eating poorly, or drinking heavily all can add to risks associated with the virus.
Randle is staying out of work for two more weeks to allow his dizziness to subside.
He anticipates having a new sense of solidarity with his patients.
“I tend to be empathetic to my patients,” he said.
"But now, being able to relate somewhat with my stroke patients, that may be something that may be different when I get back to work.”
Since the pandemic's start, we've learned a great deal about the COVID-19 virus and its impact.
People respond to the infection in different, and sometimes strange, ways.
While some may develop no symptoms, others may experience severe illness.
There's still much to learn, including if there is a connection between the virus and eye symptoms.
Knowing whether or not specific symptoms are entirely due to the COVID-19 infection – or something else – can be a challenge.
At the Nebraska Medicine Truhlsen Eye Institute, research is ongoing as we seek to understand the short-term and long-term effects of how the virus may affect our eye health.
Is COVID-19 eye a thing?
The term "COVID eye" has been floating around online when people search for answers about eye symptoms.
Although we are still learning how the virus may affect the eyes, we know that some people experience inflammation which can cause mild to severe problems in numerous areas of the body.
"Our research group has found that the virus is found in the eye's tear film," says Steven Yeh, MD, Nebraska Medicine ophthalmologist.
"This can sometimes lead to conjunctivitis, an inflammation of the clear membrane on the eye's surface.
Most often, eye symptoms are associated with systemic symptoms of COVID, including the typical features of the respiratory illness we're familiar with including cough, fever, and fatigue.
"
When the eyes are exposed to the virus, a person can develop conjunctivitis symptoms, often appearing like pink eye.
Symptoms may include:
Tearing or watery eyes Redness Swelling Irritation or pain Itching Discharge
It's important to note that while eye symptoms have been reported in relation to positive COVID-19 cases, it is uncommon for it to be the only symptom.
Although pink eye seems to be one of the more common eye symptoms, it occurs in a low percentage of people.
Research also indicates it may be more common in people with severe cases of COVID-19.
"While COVID case numbers have improved over time, vigilance and precautions are needed to protect one's health from COVID and other viruses such as influenza," says Dr. Yeh.
When to see a doctor
If you are experiencing eye pain, significant redness or decreased vision, consult an eye doctor.
These symptoms could indicate a viral infection or other problem that may need treatment.
"Your ophthalmologist will perform a full eye exam with an assessment of visual acuity, slit lamp microscope and dilated fundus examination," says Dr. Yeh.
"If you have tested positive for COVID and have eye symptoms such as swelling or redness, apply cool compresses, wash your hands frequently and avoid touching or rubbing your eye.
"
Long COVID and eye symptoms
The impact of long COVID-19 and its implications are still unfolding.
Research is ongoing, including right here in Omaha.
The research team at the Truhlsen Eye Institute is currently conducting studies on the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the eyes.
The National Institutes of Health is also funding a National Eye Institute study on long COVID-19, which seeks to understand the symptoms that may develop in many organ systems, including the eye.
If you are experiencing bothersome eye symptoms, eye pain or vision changes, call to make an appointment with an ophthalmologist at 402.559.2020.
A diminished loss of smell and taste, also referred to as anosmia is perhaps one of the biggest mysteries with COVID-19.
Neither there is any assigned treatment for it, nor a way to detect it.
For many patients with COVID-19, anosmia could be the only recognizable sign of infection and linger on for a long time.
Perhaps the most confusing thing about a diminished sense of smell is that despite a high occurrence rate amongst infected individuals, not a lot of people are able to recognize it as a typical COVID symptom- unless or until they sniff or smell something, which is one of the reasons why COVID+ patients are asked to undergo regular sniff checks.
The Fridays for Future movement held demonstrations worldwide today, demanding urgent action from governments and businesses on climate change.
In Cork, activists held a small demonstration due to Covid-19 restrictions.
The Covid pandemic is directly linked to the environmentally reckless capitalist practices that are driving climate breakdown.
These three crises facing humanity have common roots.
Emergency responses to the pandemic presage what will be required to tackle the much larger climate emergency.
Can that be done effectively without moving beyond capitalism?
This was climate week in New York, sponsored by the United Nations during the General Assembly’s annual meeting.
A public opinion survey in 27 states shows high 90 per cent rates of concern with climate issues in poorer countries, much less so in richer ones.
The finding coincides with another showing direct personal experience of climate breakdown is much higher in poorer states.
An Oxfam study finds the world’s 10 per cent best off (630 million people) responsible for an estimated 52 per cent of carbon emissions.
The richest one per cent produces 15 per cent of them – twice those produced by the world’s three billion poorest people.
Oxfam calls for wealth and carbon taxes on private jets, yachts and frequent travellers to pay for the damage.
Accelerated clearing of tropical rain forests for grazing, palm oil plantations and logging have proceeded in spite of warnings in Africa, southeast Asia and the Amazon since 1990 when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change first reported the dangers of greenhouse gases caused by carbon emissions.

Deforestation also removes the insulation forests offer from zoonotic diseases – ones that pass from animals to humans – like HIV, Sars and Ebola originating in these habitats.
Covid-19 is traced to bats in China and associated with wet markets in wild-food epidemic diseases
Together with industrialised meat and fish farming deforesting practices expose a much more urbanised humanity to many new dangers of infection, as is vividly documented by writers like Mike Davis.
These dangers include the catastrophic loss of natural diversity represented in the extinction of up to 40 per cent of natural species since the 1990s, documented by David Attenborough in coral reefs, natural ecosystems, plants, animals and insects.
A capitalist system that fails to respond does not deserve to survive
Alongside shifting Arctic ice, wildfires in California and Australia and methane gas leaks in the North Sea these warning signals of an approaching climatic tipping point come on top of the Covid emergency.
The economist Mariana Mazzucato says the world may have to resort to lockdowns again – this time in a climate emergency.
She suggests it could involve government limits on private-vehicle use, banning consumption of red meat, and extreme energy-saving measures, while fossil-fuel companies would have to stop drilling.
To avoid that, she says in a syndicated column, “we must overhaul our economic structures and do capitalism differently”.
That would include more stakeholder control by workers and consumers rather than shareholders working to relentless quarterly profit maximisation.
Longer-term planning is required.
So are strict government conditions attached to bailouts about investing in green projects and divesting from fossil fuel investments.
Radical voices
The trouble is that at least the Anglo-American varieties of capitalism controlling many environmentally reckless companies show no signs of making such a change.
Radical voices addressing the issue include Noam Chomsky and the economist Robert Pollin.
In a book published this week, Climate Crisis and the Global Green New Deal, they argue it is possible to tackle climate collapse over the next 30 years.
Chomsky says it it will not be possible to get rid of capitalism in that time, but that alternative ways of forcing change through market and state-directed policies are doable.
Pollin says: “We have to think about ways through which we can incentivise this transition that will also be egalitarian, in the sense that it will open up opportunities for small-scale enterprises.
It’s going to generate jobs, and we have to make sure those are good jobs, union jobs.
There will be jobs lost in the fossil fuel sector, so we have to create a just transition.
But that’s all within the institutions of capitalism.”
These three huge linked challenges are now out there very explicitly.
Green New Deal programmes provide much needed hope and mobilising power if the will is there.
A capitalist system that fails to respond does not deserve to survive.
NUI Galway, University of Limerick, INSIGHT SFI Centre for Data Analytics and Orreco have collaborated to produce MyCovidSymptoms.ie which tracks the spread of COVID-19 symptoms in Ireland, it has been revealed.
MyCovidSymptoms.ie is a free COVID-19 symptom logging website that will be used as a tool to quickly and easily track the spread of COVID-19 in Ireland by gathering anonymous symptom data.
Data-driven decisions
This means that researchers can more accurately estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 infections and help authorities make timely, data-driven decisions about protective measures.
MyCovidSymptoms.ie Coronavirus Symptom Checker aims to gather information about the clinical presentation of COVID-19.
This system is not intended for the diagnosis or treatment of disease but rather a collection of clinical symptoms in the context of COVID-19.
All data captured is anonymous and there is no way for it to be connected back to an individual.
The aggregate anonymous data will be provided to the Irish health authorities to help with their planning and will be used in research by NUI Galway and University of Limerick to help prevent and mitigate future pandemics.
Professor Derek O’Keeffe, consultant physician, University Hospital Galway, and professor of medical device technology at NUI Galway, is leading the research.
Innovative software solution
Prof O’Keeffe developed the innovative software solution with INSIGHT SFI Research Centre for Data Analytics (Dr Andrew Simpkin, Marc Mellotte, Carlos Tighe) and collaborators Dr Kevin Johnson, University of Limerick, and Gearóid Hynes, Conor Maguire and Kevin McGinley of Orreco, with graphic design by Eamon Whyte.
Prof O’Keeffe said: “To defeat your enemy you must know where it is and the data from MyCovidSymptoms.ie and COVID-19 testing allows us to do this.
Clinically it is important to know where COVID-19 is in the community, so that we can plan accordingly and learn more about the disease.
"Globally other leading academic institutions, such as Harvard University, USA and Kings College London, have also seen the importance of this kind of research and developed country specific solutions.
We expect that the Irish knowledge that we learn from this will help us all fight COVID-19 both now and in the future.”
Head start in testing
Dr Simpkin said: "MyCovidSymptoms.ie is an opportunity for citizen scientists to help us fight back against COVID-19.
Having a geographical and temporal picture of symptoms will allow us to answer critical research questions and give the health services a head start in testing.
"
Dr Hynes, Orreco, said: “There is a lot to be learned about COVID-19, such as how it spreads in the community and the prevalence of symptoms within the Irish population.
By providing a simple mechanism for people in Ireland to record their symptoms MyCovidSymptoms.ie helps address this knowledge gap and we at Orreco are honoured to help this initiative with our data science and software development expertise.
“
Dr Johnson, University of Limerick, said: “COVID-19 is a global problem, we need innovative solutions.
Everyone has to part to play with their different skills and that’s what my colleagues
and I have done by helping to develop MyCovidSymptoms.ie.”

At a time when Covid-19 continues to manifest in various types of rare, unheard of diseases and conditions, five Covid patients at Delhi’s Ganga Ram Hospital were reported to have suffered rectal bleeding due to CMV infection or cytomegalovirus, with one person dead, reported PTI.
Though cytomegalovirus or CMV is a common virus, it is the first time that it was reported in Covid patients 20-30 days after testing positive in April-May 2021 amid the second wave, said the report.
What is cytomegalovirus?
According to Mayo Clinic, once the body gets infected with this virus, it retains it for life.
The virus rarely causes problems in healthy people but can severely impact people with a weakened immune system.
The virus spreads easily through an infected person’s blood, saliva, urine or other body fluids and is related to the herpes virus.
CMV is a double-stranded DNA virus and a member of the human herpesvirus family.
It is a common viral infection in 50 per cent to 100 per cent of humans worldwide, depending on the age and race of the population tested, said Dr Vipulroy Rathod, senior gastroenterologist, Bhatia Hospital Mumbai.
Symptoms

“Since the virus rarely spells trouble in healthy people, most people who get it don’t even know.
The symptoms of primary CMV are mild such as sore throat, muscle aches, fatigue, swollen glands and fever,” Dr Praveen Gupta, director neurology, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurugram told indianexpress.com.
Dr Rathod mentioned that patients with CMV colitis present with non-specific symptoms, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, rectal bleeding, and weight loss.
Here’s what to know about cytomegalovirus-related rectal bleeding.

Diagnosis
Hematochezia and diarrhea are the most frequently observed symptoms in these patients.
“Therefore, a high index of suspicion is necessary, and laboratory investigations are essential in diagnosing CMV colitis.
There are certain specific blood tests and colonoscopic evaluations that can diagnose CMV-related colitis which leads to blood in stools.
Colonic mucosal biopsies stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) may reveal the typical inclusion associated with CMV colitis, “owl eye appearance” inclusion bodies, which are highly specific for CMV,” Dr Rathod told indianexpress.com.
How is it related to Covid-19?

‘If you’re pregnant or if your immune system is weakened, CMV is cause for concern.
Women who develop an active CMV infection during pregnancy can pass the virus to their babies, who might then experience symptoms.
For people who have weakened immune systems, especially people who have had an organ, stem cell or bone marrow transplant, CMV infection can be fatal’, warned Mayo Clinic.
Cytomegalovirus colitis occurs most commonly in immunocompromised hosts, including patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), organ transplantation, hematological malignancy, cancer therapy, and corticosteroid therapy, mentioned Dr Rathod.
“It is observed in few instances of Covid-19 infected patients, and the reason could be that these patients are on steroid therapy or are immunocompromised.
Underlying chronic inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis too can be a predisposing factor,” he said.
Treatment

As per Mayo Clinic
, there is no cure, but there are medications that can help treat the symptoms.
The majority of patients with CMV colitis who are immunocompetent may need no treatment with antiviral medications; because of the severity of side-effects of antiviral drugs such as ganciclovir, there is no evidence that treatment with antiviral medications in these patients will make significant differences in patient outcomes, Dr Rathod told indianexpress.com.
“Hence it is important to have high suspicious index if they develop blood in stools which could be secondary to CMV-related bleeding.
Timely diagnosis and treatment can prevent further complications,” he advised.

Many children and teenagers who developed the mysterious inflammatory syndrome that can emerge several weeks after contracting the coronavirus never had classic Covid-19 symptoms at the time of their infection, according to the largest study so far of cases in the United States.
The study, led by researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, found that in over 1,000 cases in which information about whether they got sick from their initial Covid-19 illness was available, 75 percent of the patients did not experience such symptoms.
But two to five weeks later, they became sick enough to be hospitalized for the condition, called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), which can affect multiple organs, especially the heart.
Published Tuesday in JAMA Pediatrics, the study said that “most MIS-C illnesses are believed to result from asymptomatic or mild Covid-19” followed by a hyper-inflammatory response that appears to occur when the patients’ bodies have produced their maximum level of antibodies to the virus.
Experts do not yet know why some young people, and a smaller number of adults, respond this way.
“It means primary-care pediatricians need to have a high index of suspicion for this because Covid is so prevalent in the society and children often have asymptomatic disease as their initial Covid infection,” said Dr. Jennifer Blumenthal, a pediatric intensivist and pediatric infectious disease specialist at Boston Children’s Hospital, who was not involved in the study.
As Covid-19 cases once again see an uptick in the country, the efforts to contain its spread and reduce risk of hospitalisations and deaths through booster drive are at full steam.
Getting fully vaccinated against Covid-19 is known to significantly reduce risk of a severe disease needing admission to hospital or ICU and mortality.
However, vaccines do not necessarily prevent one from getting infected with Covid and with the emergence of newer strains and subvariants of Omicron, the risk of breakthrough infections seems to have increased.

Experts on common symptoms, severity and possibility of new wave) “The main difference between the unvaccinated and vaccinated population are not the symptoms but the progression and the pace of progression of the disease," says Dr Sai Reddy(Pixabay)
Experts, note that the symptoms of Covid-19 in fully vaccinated people may progress a bit differently than in unvaccinated people.
The symptoms are expected to be milder and doctors note that during third wave, sore throat was the only symptoms in vaccinated people, while others had cough, cold, fever, sore throat, high-grade fever and body pain even after vaccination.

"The main difference between the unvaccinated and vaccinated population are not the symptoms but the progression and the pace of progression of the disease.
In an unvaccinated population, progression is rapid and disease is severe," Dr Sai Reddy, Consultant Pulmonologist, Yashoda Hospitals Hyderabad told HT Digital.
Dr Reddy says considering majority of population is already vaccinated, Covid at present is slightly different from the Covid in the past.
Vaccination may not fully protect you from Covid and this is the reason one must watch out for breakthrough infections although the symptoms may not be severe.
"Vaccination is a vital tool to prevent yourself and those around you from the life-threatening virus, and reduce the severity of the disease.
But vaccination will not mean that you will not get infected with Coronavirus at all.
All the available Coronavirus vaccines are good at protecting people against severe forms of Covid-19, but they are not 100 % effective in preventing infection.
Those fully vaccinated people with weakened immunity due to various medical conditions like cancer or chemotherapy or the ones who fail to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour are at the risk of breakthrough Covid infection," says Dr Bipin Jibhkate, Consultant critical care medicine, and ICU director Wockhardt Hospitals, Mira Road.
Common symptoms in fully vaccinated people
Sore throat was the most common symptom in vaccinated people during third wave.
Dr Jibhkate says severe symptoms such as breathing problems, brain fog, back pain, loss of speech or mobility, confusion, or chest pain have not been reported in fully vaccinated people.
"The common symptoms of Covid-19 in the ones who were fully vaccinated are a headache, cough, runny nose, fatigue, sore throat, fatigue, sneezing, fever, muscle pain, or joint pain," says Dr Bipin Jibhkate.
Dr Jibhkate says that breakthrough coronavirus infections may lead to mild or moderate illness, but assures the risk of serious Covid-19 is very low when it comes to those who don’t have any chronic health condition.
"People with vaccine breakthrough infections may spread Covid-19 to others.
However, fully vaccinated people with a breakthrough infection are less likely to have serious illness with Covid-19 than those who are unvaccinated.
Even when vaccinated people develop symptoms, they tend to be less severe than those experienced by unvaccinated individuals," says Dr Santosh Jha, Med sup., Consultant Pulmonologist, Porvoo Transition Care.
According to Dr Jha, the classic symptoms of Covid-19 in unvaccinated people are fever, continuous cough, loss of sense of smell and taste, fatigue and joint pain.
He, however, says in fully vaccinated people, Covid symptoms mimic flu symptoms and some of the most common signs are sore throat, headache, runny nose and sneezing.
Long-Covid symptoms not reported among fully vaccinated
According to Dr Bipin Jibhkate, those who were fully vaccinated did not report any serious long-Covid symptoms such as memory problems, pounding heartbeat, shortness of breath, pneumonia, gut problems, sleep issues, anxiety, or extreme fatigue (tiredness).
He adds that as per the evidence available, the patients who got admitted to the hospital were not vaccinated at all.
Dr Jibhkate concludes that even fully-vaccinated people must strictly follow the Covid norms of masking, social distancing, hand sanitizing, avoiding crowded places, not being around sick people and must take the booster dose when eligible for it.
Experts said the new omicron subvariant may be mistaken for spring allergies.
Symptoms from the new omicron variant’s subvariant — named the BA.2 variant — might be mistaken for spring allergies, experts recently told CBS News.
Why it matters: The coronavirus pandemic has hit a lull period in the United States.
As spring emerges, the new coronavirus variant symptoms might be mistaken for simple spring allergies.
Driving the news: Dr. Celine Gounder, a clinical assistant professor of medicine and infectious diseases at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, told CBS News that you can’t tell the difference between seasonal allergies and COVID-19.
“You need to take a test,” she said.
Symptoms:
Gounder said specific symptoms such as the sniffles, a cough or a stuffy nose could all be from COVID-19, the flu or seasonal allergies.
“So you have those symptoms, just take a test,” she said.
The bigger picture: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently shared a chart that explained how to tell the difference between COVID-19 and seasonal allergies.
The CDC chart said the following symptoms are from COVID-19:
Fever or chills.
Cough.
Body aches.
Headaches.
Tiredness.
Loss of taste or smell.
Shortness of breath.
Sore throat.
Sneezing.
Itchy or watery eyes.
Runny or stuffy nose.
Meanwhile, allergy symptoms often include:
As omicron subvariants continue to make up roughly all COVID cases in the U.S., marking a shift in the most common symptoms and in the virus' incubation period, how long will symptoms last?
For those who do experience symptoms, some may last longer than others.
Longer-Lasting Symptoms
Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said Tuesday that a cough will likely be the symptom that lingers longest, while a fever will be among the first symptoms to fade.
"Cough tends to be the most lingering effect.
That's true whenever you have any viral infection," Arwady said during a Facebook Live.
"You can be feeling totally better, you're still gonna have some irritation and... a cough doesn't mean you're contagious past 10 days
but that's usually the last to go away.
"
Fatigue is another symptom that can last a bit longer, she said.
The CDC says most people with COVID-19 "get better within a few days to a few weeks after infection.
"
But for some, officials note that symptoms may last even longer.
"Post-COVID conditions can include a wide range of ongoing health problems," the CDC states.
"These conditions can last weeks, months, or years.
"
Feeling out of the loop?
We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know.
Sign up for the weekly Chicago Catch-Up newsletter here.
A recent study from Northwestern Medicine showed that many so-called COVID "long-haulers" continue to experience symptoms like brain fog, tingling, headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, tinnitus and fatigue an average of 15 months after the onset of the virus.
"Long-haulers,” are defined as individuals who have had COVID symptoms for six or more weeks, the hospital system has said.
But, according to the CDC, four weeks after infection is when post-COVID conditions could first be identified.
"Most people with post-COVID conditions experienced symptoms days after their SARS CoV-2 infection when they knew they had COVID-19, but some people with post-COVID conditions did not notice when they first had an infection," the CDC states.
Long-COVID symptoms can range from a wide variety of ailments, some of which may even disappear and then return later.
"Post-COVID conditions may not affect everyone the same way.
People with post-COVID conditions may experience health problems from different types and combinations of symptoms happening over different lengths of time," the CDC reports.
"Most patients’ symptoms slowly improve with time.
However, for some people, post-COVID conditions may last months, and potentially years, after COVID-19 illness and may sometimes result in disability."
(See a list of potential long COVID symptoms here)
Shorter Symptoms
Meanwhile, Chicago's top doctor noted that a fever is one of the bigger indicators of contagiousness, and likely one of the first symptoms to disappear.
"We pay a lot of attention to fever because... while fever is ongoing there is a lot inflammation in your body, you're often very infectious and so that we usually see go away sooner," she said.
Fever is also possibly one of the first symptoms someone with COVID might experience at the onset of infection.
According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, early symptoms of COVID-19 typically include fatigue, headache, sore throat or a fever.
Some patients also experience a loss of taste or smell as an early or their first symptom, though Arwady noted there is less of that with the most recent variants than there was earlier on in the pandemic.
A study by researchers at the University of Southern California also found fever may be first, followed by a cough and muscle pain.
Then, those infected will likely experience nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
Unlike other respiratory illnesses such as MERS and SARS, COVID-19 patients will likely develop nausea and vomiting before diarrhea, the researchers found.
Digestive symptoms, in some instances, may be the first sign someone has contracted COVID.
They have been known to develop at the beginning of an infection, with respiratory symptoms possibly following a day later, according to an article from Emerson Health.
According to the CDC, COVID symptoms can appear anywhere from two to 14 days after someone is exposed to the virus.
You can end isolation after five full days if you are fever-free for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication and your other symptoms have improved.
Most Common Symptoms
The BA.4 and BA.5 variants in particular have led to a shift in the most common symptoms associated with COVID infections this summer.
"We're seeing more what we call upper respiratory symptoms more recently," Arwady said.
"We're seeing a lot of more sore throats, fatigue, still seem some fever for sure, runny nose.
Less sort of affecting the lungs, kind of whole body.
"
She added that headaches and rashes can both also be symptoms associated with the virus, though they aren't as common as the upper respiratory indicators.
Still, some symptoms, such as shortness of breath, have become less prevalent as the virus continues to mutate.
"In terms of symptoms and what people have it's been so incredibly heterogeneous," said Dr. Sharon Welbel, the director of Hospital Epidemiology and Infection Control for Cook County Health.
"I find with omicron we do know that still the most common is fever, cough - not so much shortness of breath anymore like we had with the Wuhan virus, but fever, sore throat and, as I said, cough.
"
Experts do caution patients that the severity, or even the type, of initial symptoms can vary widely from person to person.
"I think it's really variable depending from person to person," Welbel said.
"It depends on age, it depends on comorbid illness, it depends on vaccine status, if one has been infected before potentially their you know, immune system is revved up more...
So, I think that there's no way to protect it to predict it.
"
The CDC says that the median time for the appearance of symptoms in a patient with the different lineages of omicron could be just three days.
In general, symptoms will typically appear 2-to-14 days after exposure to the virus, according to the CDC.
How long they last, however, can depend on the person, the severity of their infection and whether or not they end up with long COVID.
"Some people say they feel better in a day, some people say they still have lingering symptoms after three weeks," Welbel said.
Symptoms of the virus include:
-Fever or chills
-Cough
-Shortness of breath
-Fatigue
-Muscle or body aches
-Headache
-New loss of taste or smell
-Sore throat
-Congestion or runny nose
-Nausea or vomiting
-Diarrhea
Patients are urged to seek emergency medical attention if they experience:
-Trouble breathing
-Persistent chest pain or pressure
-New confusion
-Inability to wake or stay awake
-Pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nail beds
And separate research suggests that children fare better than adults thanks to robust “first responder” immune cells that wane with age.
An international team of researchers found that in some people with severe Covid-19, the body goes rogue and attacks one of its own key immune defences instead of fighting the coronavirus.
Most were men, helping to explain why the virus is hitting men harder than women.
One of Covid-19’s scariest mysteries is why some people are mildly ill or have no symptoms and others rapidly die – and scientists are starting to unravel why.
They are the latest in a list of studies uncovering multiple features of the immune system’s intricate cascade that can tip the scales between a good or bad outcome.
Next up: figuring out if all these new clues might offer much-needed ways to intervene.

“We have the knowledge and capability of really boosting many aspects of the immune system.
But we need to not use the sledge hammer,” cautioned Dr Betsy Herold of New York’s Albert Einstein College of Medicine, who co-authored the child study.
Adding to the complexity, people’s wildly varying reactions also reflect other factors, such as how healthy they were to begin with and how much of the virus – the “dose” – they were exposed to.
“Infection and what happens after infection is a very dynamic thing,” said Alessandro Sette, a researcher at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in San Diego, who is studying yet another piece of the immune response.
There are two main arms of the immune system.
Innate immunity is the body’s first line of defence.
As soon as the body detects a foreign intruder, key molecules, such as interferons and inflammation-causing cytokines, launch a wide-ranging attack.
Innate immune cells also alert the slower-acting “adaptive” arm of the immune system, the germ-specific sharpshooters, to gear up.
B cells start producing virus-fighting antibodies, the proteins getting so much attention in the vaccine hunt.
But antibodies are not the whole story.
Adaptive immunity’s many other ingredients include “killer” T cells that destroy virus-infected cells – and “memory” T and B cells that remember an infection so they spring into action quicker if they encounter that germ again.
Usually when a virus invades a cell, proteins called Type I interferons spring into action, defending the cell by interfering with viral growth.
But new research shows those crucial molecules were essentially absent in a subset of people with severe Covid-19.
An international project uncovered two reasons.
In blood from nearly 1,000 severe Covid-19 patients, researchers found one in 10 had what are called autoantibodies – antibodies that mistakenly attack those needed virus fighters.
Especially surprising, autoimmune disorders tend to be more common in women – but 95 per cent of these Covid-19 patients were men.
The researchers did not find the damaging molecules in patients with mild or asymptomatic Covid-19.

If China’s coronavirus vaccines work, which countries will get them and for how much?
In another 660 severely ill patients, the same team found 3.5 per cent had gene mutations that did not produce Type I interferons.
Each of those silent vulnerabilities was enough to tip the balance in favour of the virus early on, said Dr. Jean-Laurent Casanova, an infectious disease geneticist at Rockefeller University in New York, who co-leads the Covid Human Genetic Effort.
He is paid by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which also helps fund the Associated Press Health and Science Department.
Certain interferons are used as medicines and are under study as a possible Covid-19 treatment; the autoantibody discovery adds another factor to consider.
It is not clear why children appear less at risk from Covid-19.
But occasionally they are sick enough for hospitalisation, giving Herold’s team the opportunity to compare 60 adults and 65 children and teens at New York’s Montefiore Health System.
The children produced much higher levels of certain cytokines that are among the innate immune system’s first responders.
When the immune system’s next stage kicked in, both adults and children made antibodies targeting the coronavirus.
Here’s the rub: the adults’ adaptive immune response was more the type that can trigger an inflammatory overreaction.
The findings suggest children‘s’ early robust reaction lets their immune system get ahead of the virus, making an overreaction less likely “and that’s protecting them”, Herold said.
The coronavirus that causes Covid-19 is new to humans.
But Sette’s team studied blood samples that were stored in freezers before the pandemic and found some harboured memory T cells that recognised a tiny portion of the new virus in laboratory tests.
“You can actually tell that this is an experienced T cell.
This has seen combat before,” Sette said.
Researchers in Germany, Britain and other countries have made similar findings.
The new coronavirus has cousins that cause as many as 30 per cent of common colds, so researchers believe those T cells could be remnants from past colds.

But despite the speculation, “we don’t know yet” that having those T cells makes any difference in who gets seriously sick with Covid-19, noted Rory de Vries, co-author of a study in the Netherlands that also found such T cells in old blood.
All these findings beg for a deeper understanding of the myriad ways some people can be more susceptible than others.
“We need to look quite broadly and not jump into premature conclusions about any one particular facet of the immune system,” said Stanford University immunologist Bali Pulendran.
He also has found some innate immune cells “in a state of hibernation” in seriously ill adults and next is looking for differences before and after people get sick.
But, “it’s not just all about the immune system”, cautioned Dr. Anita McElroy, a viral immunity expert at the University of Pittsburgh who is closely watching the research.
A way to tell in advance who’s most at risk?
“We’re a long, long way from that.”

Omicron appears to produce milder symptoms compared to previous strains of the virus, in fact, many of those infected won't display any symptoms at all.
But many Brits may have been unaware they were spreading the disease as they failed to spot these six lesser-known signs of the virus.
Here are the six distinctive symptoms associated with the Omicron variant .
Heart attack: The drink that could trigger a sudden cardiac arrest
Vitamin B12 deficiency: A sign to look out for in your poo
Most Britons associate Covid with the main symptoms listed on the NHS website, these are: a new persistent cough, a loss of smell or taste or a high temperature.
Although the NHS states these are still the main symptoms of Covid, new data suggests Omircon produces symptoms similar to the common cold, such as a runny nose, headaches or feeling fatigued.
However, the ZOE Covid study has helped to find far more symptoms associated with the virus than have been previously identified.
Increasingly, those testing positive for the Omicron strain are reporting these six skin conditions.
READ MORE: Two key Omicron symptoms to watch out for
Some 85% of people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 showed no symptoms other than, possibly, a cough and runny nose, and many had actually been about to travel, the superintendent of public health said on Monday.
Charmaine Gauci told Times of Malta’s Ask Charmaine programme that the new Omicron variant has still not been found in Malta but the expectation is that it will be identified very soon.
Sequencing took five days, she explained, and therefore she could not rule out that the increase in virus cases in the past few days was caused by Omicron.
But there were also other reasons for the increase, including the fact that more people were gathering and socialising.
The authorities were seeing more infections among households, with the infection spreading before the carriers knew about it, she said.
There were also quite a number of workplace cases, especially in closed environments where masks were not worn.
Asked whether more restrictions were to be expected, Gauci said the situation, especially in hospital was being closely monitored.
The good news was that take-up for the highly-effective booster shots was very good.
Although the number of COVID-19 cases in hospital had gone up, a significant proportion of those patients had not been admitted because of coronavirus, but other causes.
The majority of virus patients in hospital were aged 24-49, an age group which had not been given the booster jab yet.
It was for that reason too that none of the ITU patients was aged over 60.
She said the number of hospital cases – currently 42 – was expected to increase in the coming two weeks.
But she appealed to people even having minor symptoms, to come forward and get tested to prevent spread.
Mitigation measures – keep your mask on
The authorities, she said, would continue to ensure that mitigation measures were proportionate.
While it was true that people had been complaining about mandatory mask-wearing outdoors, that was a small inconvenience to other measures, such as closing restaurants and curfews, that were being imposed abroad.
In Malta, the authorities were requiring mask-wearing even by people out on their own, or with their families, because the likelihood that they would meet somebody else was high, she said.
Will schools reopen in the next term?
Asked by Times of Malta news editor Diana Cacciottolo whether schools would reopen in the next term, Gauci pointed out that children are being vaccinated now.
And no major clusters – anything above five – had been found in schools, because mitigation measures there were working.
The fact was that children were not being infected in schools and passing it to the community, but the other way around.
She underlined the need for children, even those aged 5-11 to be vaccinated once parents received their invitations.
This prevented any possible severe complications from COVID – although none had been seen in Malta so far.
And vaccines also reduced the likelihood of children being infected and then also requiring their classmates and families to quarantine.
Imported cases only 6% of the total
Asked if Malta would require negative swab tests for travel arrivals, Gauci said Malta was among the first countries to require arrivals to produce a vaccination certificate and that was more effective than a negative test result.
One could produce a negative test result, only to develop symptoms some days down the line, during a holiday, she said.
The effectiveness of the measures taken by Malta could be seen in the fact that only 6% of Covid cases had been imported.
Nonetheless, the situation would continue to be monitored, especially within the EU.
Self-testing is not reliable
Asked if Malta would allow self-testing using later flow tests (rapid testing)
Gauci said self-testing was difficult and unpleasant.
As a result many people did not test themselves properly and the results were not reliable.
People could have Covid and end up showing a negative result.
Tests would therefore continue to be offered for free in the various testing centres.
They were also being made available by the private sector.
As for recent difficulties by some people to access the 111 helpline, she said the centre was swamped by people seeking clarifications after Italy introduced a test requirement for travellers a few days ago.
More staff had been added to the helpline, but people were being asked to keep their conversations short.
Quarantine to remain at 14 days
Asked why quarantine was not reduced to 10 days after a negative test, as some countries had done, Gauci explained that there are some 5,000 people in quarantine at the moment, including those who tested positive and contacts.
At the peak, there were some 7,000.
Quarantine had to remain at 14 days for those who tested positive because the characteristics of the new Omicron variant were not fully known yet.
One could still have traces that could be transmitted.
Asked about people who tested positive immediately after taking the booster jab, Gauci said the booster did not have any virus particles, and those who tested positive probably had the virus before being jabbed.
“The vaccine does not give you COVID, but protects you from COVID,” he said.
You've probably heard someone complaining about their allergies recently.
Or maybe that somebody was you.
You're not alone, with there being "record mold levels" this week in the Milwaukee area, according to Gary Steven of the Allergy, Asthma and Sinus Center in Greenfield.
But with COVID-19 in the mix, how can you tell whether your symptoms are just fall allergies or the virus?
Here are a few ways to differentiate between the two, what to do if you're still unsure and a look at the "very high" mold counts the area is experiencing.
COVID-19 versus allergy symptoms
Coronavirus symptoms can include, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:
fever or chills
cough
shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
fatigue
muscle or body aches
headache
new loss of taste or smell
sore throat
congestion or runny nose
nausea or vomiting
diarrhea
Allergy symptoms can include, according to Steven:
sneezing
itchy, watery red eyes
nasal congestion
post-nasal drainage — where secretions from your nose drip into your throat and can trigger a cough
possible asthma exacerbation in people with asthma,
Allergy symptoms are all the same regardless of what the allergen is, said Steven, who is certified by the American Board of Allergy and Immunology
People have antibodies against different allergens.
"When you expose yourself to those allergens, they bind to those antibodies," he said.
"That causes histamine release, which causes all of those symptoms.
"
Fever, chills and muscle aches?
More likely COVID-19
One of the biggest indicators that someone could be experiencing COVID-19 as opposed to allergies is fever, Steven said.
"You get a fever with viral infections," he said.
"You do not get a fever with allergic responses.
"
Chills and muscle aches also point to a viral infection, he added.
Symptoms change in new environments: Likely allergies
If someone goes outside and "all of a sudden" experiences congestion and sneezing, but then those symptoms go away within few hours of being indoors or after a shower, that's a sign of allergies over COVID-19, Steven said.
Loss of smell without congestion: Likely COVID-19
While the loss of sense of smell is not as consistent with the delta variant as it was with the original strain, Steven said, it could still be a helpful differentiating factor.
If someone isn't terribly congested, but loses their sense of smell, it would not be due to allergies, he said.
"People will tell you they lose their sense of smell with allergies, but that's because their nose is really congested," he said in a previous Journal Sentinel interview.
With allergies, the loss of smell is a result of air being blocked from getting to the receptors for the sense of smell in the nose, he said.
What do I do if I'm unsure?
If you're on the fence, get tested for COVID-19, Steven said.
If someone's symptoms are mild, he recommends that they get the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test as opposed to the rapid antigen.
If someone is symptomatic, rapid antigen tests do a "pretty decent job" of detecting COVID-19, he said.
But if someone's symptoms are minimal, this test is not as good as the PCR, he said.
What Milwaukee mold counts are
Mold is currently the only prevalent allergen in the Milwaukee area.
Ragweed season ended about a week and a half ago, Steven said.
His center performs its own pollen and mold counts daily.
The center's mold count Monday was 88,397 spores per cubic meter of air, which was the third highest of the year, according to Steven.
On Aug. 25, the count was 96,500 and on Aug. 11, it was 88,763.
"We're not as hot and humid as we typically are when you see mold counts like this, but we're still way warmer than normal," he said.
"You're getting started with the fall decomposition, where we've been getting the leaves coming down.
But they usually go on a pretty slow roll because it's a lot cooler than this.
It's warm enough that the molds can really go to town.
"
In the past 25 years, the center's previous mold record was 73,946 spores per cubic meter of air, which was set on July 22, 2012, according to Steven.
And the previous October record, which was 36,826, came on October 24, 2012.
The center's historical averages are calculated from multi‐day rolling averages using data collected since 1995, the center's website said.
Tuesday's mold count was 50,036, which is still considered "very high."
The predominant species were cladosporium, basidiospores and ascospores.
The colder it gets, the less prevalent mold becomes.
How the center determines mold, pollen counts
The center uses a Burkard spore trap to capture pollen and mold spores on its Greenfield roof.
The trap draws air into the chamber and particles hit a glass microscope slide that's coated with silicone grease.
They stick to the grease, then the center stains and counts them under a microscope.
The center plans to continue measuring through the end of October, then will resume in March or April, when trees begin to bud.
When there are three consecutive days with a count above 10, the first of those days is the official start to a pollen season, Steven said.
Once there are three consecutive days with a count below 10, the first of those days is the official end.
How to treat allergy symptoms
To alleviate bothersome allergy symptoms, Steven suggested an over-the-counter, non-drowsy allergy medication, which he previously told the Journal Sentinel "work much better, they last longer and they don't impair performance when operating machinery and stuff like that," Steven said in a previous Journal Sentinel interview.
Nasal steroid sprays can also help and are available over the counter as well, he said.
He has a video on how to properly use those on the "Patient Resources" tab on his website, myaasc.com.
If issues persist, such as, being too stuffy to breathe through your nose at night or getting sinus infections multiple times a year, he recommends seeing a doctor or allergist.
"It drives me nuts the amount of suffering people put up with before going to see the doctor," he said in a previous interview.
"They get a mechanic to look at their car, but they try to treat their medical conditions themselves.
You just end up wasting a lot of money and doing needless suffering.
"
How to arm yourself against COVID-19
Steven "absolutely" recommends getting the COVID-19 vaccine.
He said he brings it up to all of his eligible patients.
"It has become about politics, but it never should have," he said.
"This is a public health thing.
"
According to Monday's data, the number of Wisconsin residents who are fully vaccinated was 3,165,184, which is 54.4% of the population.
There have been 3,326,299 residents (57.1% of the population) who have received one dose.
The total number of doses administered was 6,421,777, Monday's numbers showed.

Nearly 18 months after getting covid-19 and spending weeks in the hospital, Terry Bell struggles with hanging up his shirts and pants after doing the laundry.
Lifting his clothes, raising his arms, arranging items in his closet leave Bell short of breath and often trigger severe fatigue.
He walks with a cane, only short distances.
He’s 50 pounds lighter than when the virus struck.
Bell, 70, is among millions of older adults who have grappled with long covid — a population that has received little attention even though research suggests seniors are more likely to develop the poorly understood condition than younger or middle-aged adults.
Long covid refers to ongoing or new health problems that occur at least four weeks after a covid infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Much about the condition is baffling: There is no diagnostic test to confirm it, no standard definition of the ailment, and no way to predict who will be affected.
Common symptoms, which can last months or years, include fatigue, shortness of breath, an elevated heart rate, muscle and joint pain, sleep disruptions, and problems with attention, concentration, language, and memory — a set of difficulties known as brain fog.
Ongoing inflammation or a dysfunctional immune response may be responsible, along with reservoirs of the virus that remain in the body, small blood clots, or residual damage to the heart, lungs, vascular system, brain, kidneys, or other organs.
Only now is the impact on older adults beginning to be documented.
In the largest study of its kind, published recently in the journal BMJ, researchers estimated that 32% of older adults in the U.S. who survived covid infections had symptoms of long covid up to four months after infection — more than double the 14% rate an earlier study found in adults ages 18 to 64.
(Other studies suggest symptoms can last much longer, for a year or more.)
The BMJ study examined more than 87,000 adults 65 and older who had covid infections in 2020, drawing on claims data from UnitedHealth Group’s Medicare Advantage plans.
It included symptoms that lasted 21 days or more after an infection, a shorter period than the CDC uses in its long covid definition.
The data encompasses both older adults who were hospitalized because of covid (27%) and those who were not (73%).
The higher rate of post-covid symptoms in older adults is likely due to a higher incidence of chronic disease and physical vulnerability in this population — traits that have led to a greater burden of serious illness, hospitalization, and death among seniors throughout the pandemic.
“On average, older adults are less resilient.
They don’t have the same ability to bounce back from serious illness,” said Dr. Ken Cohen, a co-author of the study and executive director of translational research for Optum Care.
Optum Care is a network of physician practices owned by UnitedHealth Group.
Applying the study’s findings to the latest data from the CDC suggests that up to 2.5 million older adults may have been affected by long covid.
For those individuals, the consequences can be devastating: the onset of disability, the inability to work, reduced ability to carry out activities of daily life, and a lower quality of life.
But in many seniors, long covid is difficult to recognize.
“The challenge is that nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, pain, confusion, and increased frailty are things we often see in seriously ill older adults.
Or people may think, ‘That’s just part of aging,’” said Dr. Charles Thomas Alexander Semelka, a postdoctoral fellow in geriatric medicine at Wake Forest University.
Ann Morse, 72, of Nashville, Tennessee, was diagnosed with covid in November 2020 and recovered at home after a trip to the emergency room and follow-up home visits from nurses every few days.
She soon began having trouble with her memory, attention, and speech, as well as sleep problems and severe fatigue.
Though she’s improved somewhat, several cognitive issues and fatigue persist to this day.
“What was frustrating was I would tell people my symptoms and they’d say, ‘Oh, we’re like that too,’ as if this was about getting older,” she told me.
“And I’m like, but this happened to me suddenly, almost overnight.”
Terry Bell, who spent two weeks in intensive care and has been diagnosed with long covid, says he now walks with a cane for only short distances and is 50 pounds lighter than before getting sick.
(Bob McReynolds)
Bell, a singer-songwriter in Nashville, had a hard time getting adequate follow-up attention after spending two weeks in intensive care and an additional five weeks in a nursing home receiving rehabilitation therapy.
“I wasn’t getting answers from my regular doctors about my breathing and other issues.
They said take some over-the-counter medications for your sinus and things like that,” he said.
Bell said his real recovery began after he was recommended to specialists at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
James Jackson, director of long-term outcomes at Vanderbilt’s Critical Illness, Brain Dysfunction, and Survivorship Center, runs several long covid support groups that Morse and Bell attend and has worked with hundreds of similar patients.
He estimates that about a third of those who are older have some degree of cognitive impairment.
“We know there are significant differences between younger and older brains.
Younger brains are more plastic and effective at reconstituting, and our younger patients seem able to regain their cognitive functioning more quickly,” he said.
In extreme cases, covid infections can lead to dementia.
That may be because older adults who are severely ill with covid are at high risk of developing delirium — an acute and sudden change in mental status — which is associated with the subsequent development of dementia, said Dr. Liron Sinvani, a geriatrician and an assistant professor at Northwell Health’s Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research in Manhasset, New York.
Older patients’ brains also may have been injured from oxygen deprivation or inflammation.
Or disease processes that underlie dementia may already have been underway, and a covid infection may serve as a tipping point, hastening the emergence of symptoms.

Research conducted by Sinvani and colleagues, published in March, found that 13% of covid patients who were 65 and older and hospitalized at Northwell Health in March 2020 or April 2020 had evidence of dementia a year later.
Dr. Thomas Gut, associate chair of medicine at Staten Island University Hospital, which opened one of the first long covid clinics in the U.S., observed that becoming ill with covid can push older adults with preexisting conditions such as heart failure or lung disease “over the edge” to a more severe impairment.
In older adults especially, he said, “it’s hard to attribute what’s directly related to covid and what’s a progression of conditions they already have.”
That wasn’t true for Richard Gard, 67, who lives just outside New Haven, Connecticut, a self-described “very healthy and fit” sailor, scuba diver, and music teacher at Yale University who contracted covid in March 2020.
He was the first covid patient treated at Yale New Haven Hospital, where he was critically ill for 2½ weeks, including five days in intensive care and three days on a ventilator.
Richard Gard described himself as a “very healthy and fit” sailor, scuba diver, and music teacher at Yale University before he was hospitalized in intensive care after contracting covid in March 2020.
He has since spent more than two months in the hospital, often for symptoms that resemble a heart attack.
(Richard Gard)
In the two years since, Gard has spent more than two months in the hospital, usually for symptoms that resemble a heart attack.
“If I tried to walk up the stairs or 10 feet, I would almost pass out with exhaustion, and the symptoms would start — extreme chest pain radiating up my arm into my neck, trouble breathing, sweating,” he said.
Dr. Erica Spatz, director of the preventive cardiovascular health program at Yale, is one of Gard’s physicians.
“The more severe the covid infection and the older you are, the more likely it is you’ll have a cardiovascular complication after,” she said.
Complications include weakening of the heart muscle, blood clots, abnormal heart rhythms, vascular system damage, and high blood pressure.
Gard’s life has changed in ways he never imagined.
Unable to work, he takes 22 medications and can still walk only 10 minutes on level ground.
Post-traumatic stress disorder is a frequent, unwanted companion.
“A lot of times it’s been difficult to go on, but I tell myself I just have to get up and try one more time,” he told me.
“Every day that I get a little bit better, I tell myself I’m adding another day or week to my life.”

Updated 21 March 2023
We explain how Covid can affect your heart and circulatory system, and what to do if you experience symptoms such as a fast heart rate or heart palpitations.
Our fortnightly Heart Matters newsletter includes the latest updates about coronavirus when you have a heart condition, as well as support for healthy eating, staying active and your emotional wellbeing.
Is there a link between coronavirus and heart conditions?
A recent study, published in the journal Cardiovascular Research in January 2023, followed a group of over 7,500 people with and without pre-existing heart conditions, who caught Covid-19 between March and November 2020 (which is before the vaccine was available in the UK).
Compared to uninfected people, this group was around 40% more likely to develop cardiovascular disease and five times more likely to die during the 18 months afterwards.
People who had experienced severe infection were at even higher risk.
Both in the short-term and long-term, those previously infected were at higher risk of the following heart and circulatory system problems:
They were also at higher risk of stroke and atrial fibrillation in the short-term, but not the long-term.
How can coronavirus affect your heart and circulatory system?
Covid-19 can affect your heart and circulatory system in many ways.
For example, it can lead to a faster heart rate, atrial fibrillation, blood clots, heart damage due to a lack of oxygen and nutrients, inflammation of the heart muscle and lining, or Takotsubo syndrome (broken heart syndrome).
Many symptoms that people experience are thought to be linked to the virus damaging the endothelium (the inner lining of blood vessels in our body).
All parts of the body need a healthy blood supply to work properly - damage to your blood vessels can lead to abnormal blood clotting, ‘leaky’ blood vessels, reduced blood flow throughout the body, and a range of symptoms.
This could be a factor in why people with existing heart and circulatory conditions are at a higher risk of complications from Covid-19.
But the virus can also cause heart and circulatory complications in those without existing heart disease.
This is an area where we are still learning more as new research is carried out.
A fast heart rate or heart palpitations after Covid
Covid-19 can cause your heart rate to become fast or irregular in response to fever or inflammation, as your heart works harder to pump more blood around your body to fight the infection.
Changes to your heart rate can also happen for other common reasons, including dehydration, anxiety, medications, as well as other health conditions.
Learn more about what things can cause your heart rate to become fast.
Heart palpitations are when you become more aware of your heartbeat – this can feel like a fluttering or pounding sensation in your chest.
Palpitations are not usually a cause for concern, but it’s a good idea to get medical attention if you're worried about them, or if the palpitations last a long time, do not improve or get worse, or if you have a history of heart problems.
Researchers are still looking into why people might experience changes to their heart rate after Covid, but it’s thought that this could be due to the virus and the immune response affecting the autonomic nervous system (rather than the heart muscle itself).
This is the part of the nervous system that works automatically to regulate essential body processes, like blood pressure, heart rate and breathing rate.
Call 999 if you feel palpitations or a faster heartbeat and you also have chest pain, or dizziness, or blackouts.
Blood clots
People who develop severe illness from Covid-19 are at a higher risk of blood clots.
This is thought to be due to damage to the blood vessels, either directly caused by the virus or as a result of the body’s immune response to the infection.
Depending on where in your body they are, blood clots can cause serious problems such as deep vein thrombosis, clots in the blood vessels in the lung (pulmonary embolism), heart attack or stroke.
Read more about how coronavirus affects the blood vessels
Lack of oxygen and nutrients causing heart damage
Covid-19 can cause fever and inflammation, which places extra stress on the heart as your body fights the infection.
This can also cause your heart rate to become fast or irregular.
If the Covid infection is severe enough that it damages the lungs, this can reduce the amount of oxygen that reaches the heart.
As the virus and the immune response to it can also damage the cells that line the blood vessels, this can also cause clots in the blood vessels that supply the lungs and limit the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the heart.
This extra demand on the heart, paired with the lack of oxygen and nutrients, can cause damage to the heart muscle.
We know that patients in hospital with severe cases of coronavirus who have evidence of heart muscle injury as shown by blood tests) have a higher risk of dying.
In some patients, further tests called echocardiograms have found that the heart isn’t pumping as well as it should (heart failure).
What isn’t always clear is whether that damage was already there, although many researchers believe that the virus can damage heart muscle function.
More reassuringly, a BHF-funded study on mild Covid-19 infection and its longer-term impact on the heart, published in the Journals of the American College of Cardiology in May 2021, found that mild cases of Covid-19 do not appear to be linked to lasting heart damage.
Inflammation of the heart muscle and lining
Covid-19 can cause inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) and heart lining (pericarditis).
Myocarditis and pericarditis can also be caused by other viral infections, not just Covid-19.
A study led by researchers at the BHF Cardiovascular Research Centre at the University of Glasgow, published in May 2022, found that 1 in 8 people who were hospitalised with Covid-19 were later diagnosed with myocarditis.
The study also showed that in addition to heart inflammation, severe Covid can cause inflammation across the body and damage to the kidneys.
The research, which followed 159 people who were hospitalised between May 2020 and March 2021, found that the risk of myocarditis was much higher in those who were severely ill (needing a ventilator or treatment in intensive care).
Almost all patients involved in this study were unvaccinated, which means they were already at a higher risk of severe illness from Covid-19.
This research was carried out before the Omicron variant was detected in the UK, and we know that generally people who catch this variant experience milder symptoms.
Earlier in the pandemic, scientists thought that myocarditis may be caused by the virus attacking the heart muscle cells directly.
But as we learn more, many researchers now think this damage to the heart can be the result of the immune system overreacting to the infection.
For example, BHF-funded researchers at the University of Cambridge have been investigating how cytokines (molecules that the cells in your immune system use to communicate with each other, which are known to be involved in inflammation) found in the blood of people with Covid-19 can prevent heart muscle cells from working properly
While many people can have mild injury to the heart without any symptoms, in some severe cases it can cause shortness of breath, chest pain or abnormal heart rhythms.
If you notice any of these symptoms, you should seek medical advice.
Takotsubo syndrome ("broken heart syndrome")
Takotsubo syndrome, sometimes known as "broken heart syndrome", happens when the left pumping chamber of the heart rapidly changes shape and becomes larger, weakening the heart so it’s less able to pump blood around the body.
It often occurs in response to an emotional or stressful event.
In many cases, the heart recovers.
During the pandemic there was a rise in the number of people being diagnosed with Takotsubo, not all of whom have had Covid-19.
However, it’s worth remembering that overall, this condition is still relatively rare – it’s been estimated that around one in fifty people who go to hospital with chest pain symptoms actually have Takotsubo.
More research needs to be done to understand the reasons behind this increase, but it’s thought that in addition to the stress of the pandemic, inflammation caused by the body’s immune response to the virus could also be behind the link.
It’s also possible that this level of Takotsubo syndrome was present before, but people have become more aware of it.
How does coronavirus affect the lungs?
In severe cases of Covid-19, the infection moves down the respiratory tract to the lungs, where it can cause pneumonia.
If you get pneumonia, your lungs might not be able to supply as much oxygen to the bloodstream, so you may need hospital treatment.
It’s now also understood that one of the ways coronavirus can prevent the lungs from working properly is through damaging small blood vessels in the lungs.
This can cause blood clots and fluid to accumulate in the lungs, which means they are less able to get oxygen into the body.
If you develop pneumonia, in addition to the common signs of Covid-19, you may notice symptoms like a rapid heartbeat, breathlessness, or pain in your chest.
If you experience any of these symptoms when you are ill with Covid-19, you should call 999.
How long does it take to recover from Covid?
Most people who get Covid-19 either have no symptoms at all, or a mild illness which feels similar to a cold or flu.
If your infection is mild, you should feel better in a few days or weeks.
A small number of people develop a more severe illness which means they need to go to hospital.
If you have been seriously ill with Covid, this may increase the time it takes to recover.
Some people are also experiencing symptoms that last for months after the initial infection.
This is referred to as ‘long Covid’, which can include symptoms such as fatigue, feeling short of breath or having heart palpitations.
While long Covid is more common in people who needed hospital treatment due to Covid, it’s still possible to develop long Covid after a mild infection.
Can coronavirus cause diabetes?
There is some evidence of a link between Covid-19 and an increased risk of developing diabetes in the weeks after infection.
Research led by scientists at King’s College London, including BHF Professor Ajay Shah, suggests that the risk of diabetes is 81% higher in the four weeks after a Covid-19 infection, but this falls back towards pre-Covid risk levels after five to six months.
The study, published in July 2022, compared the health records of over 428,000 Covid patients with people of the same age and gender, who had not tested positive for Covid.
While this was a large study with important findings, it doesn’t prove that Covid itself causes diabetes.
There may be other reasons for this link.
For example, it’s possible that some of the Covid patients already had diabetes, and catching the virus also made them more likely to be diagnosed.
This could be because catching Covid progressed their diabetes, or because they were in more frequent contact with their doctor.
There were also other differences between the Covid-19 cases and the control group.
For example, the Covid cases in this study tended to have more pre-existing health conditions and were less healthy in general.
These factors could mean they were already at a higher risk of diabetes before catching Covid.
It’s also possible that some of the control group also had Covid without realising it (the Covid group was based on those with the illness confirmed by a PCR test), which could affect the results.
Although the evidence is mixed, some small studies have also suggested that Covid-19 can cause similar effects to diabetes.
Diabetes is a condition where your body doesn’t produce enough of the hormone insulin or can’t use the insulin it does make, which can raise levels of glucose (a type of sugar) in your blood.
These studies suggest that Covid-19 can cause insulin-producing cells to die or to produce less insulin.
These studies have mostly been carried out in the lab, not in actual people, so more research is needed to confirm this theory.
More research is needed to further understand the link between diabetes and Covid-19, including what causes the link, and whether these changes are permanent or reversible.
In the meantime, you may want to consider steps to reduce your diabetes risk if you’ve recently had Covid, such as a heart-healthy diet and increasing activity levels.
If you experience any symptoms of diabetes, contact your GP.

Ear pain has been cited on a tracker app as a new symptom of the new Omicron variant following a surge in reported cases among Brits.
People using the ZOE app have cited ear pain and a 'ringing sensation' after contracting the strain.
As a result, the app has added the symptom to its weekly ranking of the most commonly reported Covid symptoms.
Ear pain has been seen as a symptom in Omicron cases previously but only now is it being recognised as more common than previously thought, the Mirror reports.
Last year, a study carried out by Stanford university and Dr Kristina Stankovic discovered that the variant could cause problems with the ear.
The study reported symptoms including numbness and even temporary hearing loss and it has been said that this symptom can appear even in people who have been fully vaccinated.

Speaking to the Times Now News Portal, Dr Stankovic said: “Pain is often associated with ringing in the ears.
Surprisingly, these symptoms, although more rarely, can also appear in patients who have been vaccinated with a full course.
"
She has urged people who experience these symptoms not to dismiss them and to take a Covid-19 test.
Brits can no longer have testing kits for free after the scheme was stopped, with those looking to test having to buy from local pharmacies or online.
The new symptom has been added to the list after a number of people with the virus made reference to trouble with their ears.
A number of Brit sufferers cited ringing ears as something they have experienced after contracting Omicron.
Covid infection levels have hit a record high across the UK as free Covid-19 testing for millions in England comes to an end.
Some 4.9 million people in the UK are estimated to have had Covid-19 in the week ending March 2, up from 4.3 million in the previous week, the Office for National Statistics said.
TAMPA, Fla. — New research shows more people are being affected by long COVID.
“Long COVID is actually quite common,” said Dr. Thomas Unnasch, distinguished USF Health Professor.
“As high as one in four people suffer long-term symptoms after resolving their COVID-19 infections,” he added.
Long COVID is when you experience any new, returning, or ongoing problems for four weeks or more after a COVID-19 infection.
“This even happens to people who have had mild infections, initial mild symptoms.
They will sometimes develop these long COVID symptoms after they recover,” said Unnasch.
The government estimates anywhere from 7.7 million people to 23 million people in the U.S. have developed long COVID.
“It’s not really clear how long these last.
Something like 80% of them resolve in about a year, but there are other ones that have been dragging on since the initial start of the epidemic.
People who have those are still having problems with all sorts of issues along the way,” said Unnasch.
Since the COVID-19 virus can affect any part of your body, doctors said people could have all kinds of long COVID symptoms.
Some of the most common ones are chronic fatigue, shortness of breath, heart palpitations and body aches.
“We have a lot of people who were athletes before and now can’t have such serious pulmonary symptoms they can’t even climb two or three flights of stairs,” said Unnasch.
According to a recent large-scale study out of the U.K., adults who’ve had a COVID-19 infection have a high risk of developing seizure disorders, brain fog, dementia, and other mental health conditions as a result of long COVID.
“Millions of people may end up suffering long-term consequences as a result of this infection,” said Unnasch.
There are also new data about how children are being impacted by long COVID.
That same study showed that children have a higher risk of developing epilepsy following an infection.
A recent report from the CDCfound kids who have long COVID are more at risk of getting serious lung, heart, kidney, and pancreatic problems.
“We thought originally that this was just going to be cold in kids and sniffles and that this wasn’t going to be a big deal, but there is quite a large increase in a large number of pretty serious long-term symptoms as a result of this in kids,” said Unnasch.
However, children seem to be less affected by long COVID than adults are.
One study published last month estimates about 5-10% of children who’ve had a COVID-19 infection now have long COVID.
“But still 5% of all the kids in this country is a large number of kids, or worldwide even that may end up having long term problems associated with the COVID infection,” said Unnasch.
The American Academy of Pediatrics reports nearly 14.3 million children have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, and about 371,000 of these cases have been added in the past four weeks.
Experts predict long COVID numbers will climb as the virus continues to spread in our communities.
“This is going to be a long-term thing that we’re going to have to deal with as a public health problem for probably years or decades to come,” said Unnasch.
Doctors said the problem with long COVID is there’s no test for it and no specific drug to take to help symptoms.
“This is a really unfortunate virus, highly infectious.”
Scientists believe even milder variants are having the same long-term consequences.
“COVID with a vaccination and with the variants that we have now is much less of threat of killing you, but it may give you lingering symptoms that really decrease your quality of life for quite a long period of time,” said Unnasch.

Coronavirus new strain symptoms: Three signs you've had the virus
Health experts have found changes to the mouth, hands or feet could be the latest warning signs of COVID-19 sparking concern whether it should be added to the official symptom list.
Researchers found that 25 percent of COVID-19 patients had tongue inflammation or bumps, and ulcers present in their mouths.
Researchers also found that nearly 40 percent of those patients had redness, burning and hives seen on the palms of their hands and soles of their feet.

The covid variant XBB.1.16, also known as Arcturus , is believed to be behind the current surge in coronavirus cases in India.
Over 10,000 covid cases were reported in India over the past 24 hours in the country, with many experts saying that the next few weeks could be crucial.
"The XBB 1.16 variant is the primary cause of the rise in cases among children and adults.
This variant is showing immune escape and is able to evade the immune system.
It is infecting those who had the Covid infection during the previous waves and also teenagers and adults who have been vaccinated," Dr Dhiren Gupta, senior pediatrician at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, told news agency ANI.
The Union Ministry recently held a two-day nationwide mock drill across hospitals to evaluate preparedness against the virus.
The World Health Organization is keeping a close eye on covid subvariant XBB.1.16 (Arcturus), which was added to its list of variants under monitoring (VUMs) on 22 March 2023.
According to WHO, XBB.1.16 is a recombinant of BA.2.10.1 and BA.2.75 and has three additional mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (E180V, F486P and K478R) compared to its parent lineage XBB, the WHO said.
However, WHO said so far reports do not indicate a rise in hospitalizations, ICU admissions, or deaths due to XBB.1.16.
Further, there are currently no reported laboratory studies on markers of disease severity for XBB.1.16.The common symptoms of this variant include the signs of upper respiratory illnesses like headache, sore throat, and blocked nose accompanied by fever and muscle pain, Apollo Hospitals said on its website.
The variant can also affect your digestive system resulting in diarrhoea, it added.
Experts believe that XBB 1.16 variant is believed to be highly contagious.
"All eyes should be on India!
If XBB.1.16 aka #Arcturus could succeed to wade through the ‘sturdy’ population immunity of Indians that successfully resisted the onslaught of variants like BA.2.75, BA.5, BQs, XBB.1.5, then whole world must be seriously worried!!
said Dr Vipin M. Vashishtha in a tweet.
"For the last 2 days, have started getting pediatric Covid cases once again after a gap of 6 mo!
An infantile phenotype seems emerging—treated infants w/ high fever, cold & cough, & non-purulent, itchy conjunctivitis w/ sticky eyes, not seen in earlier waves," he added.
The Consultant General Pediatrician at Madhukar Rainbow Children's Hospital, Dr S K Nakra, told ANI that among the Covid positive cases, conjunctivitis has also been reported in some cases.
"The symptoms of Covid 19 are high fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, headache, body aches and gastrointestinal symptoms.
Red sticky eyes (conjunctivitis) has been also been reported by some physicians.
However, this was seen in the earlier strains also in about 1-3 per cent of Covid patients.
It is too early to say that this red eye is more common with XBB 1.16 variant," he told ANI.Delhi AIIMS on Wednesday issued an advisory after some of its staffers tested positive.
"Must use reusable cloth face cover/surgical mask in the workplace.
Ensure proper cleaning and frequent sanitation of the workplace, particularly of the frequently touched surfaces," the AIIMS management said in an advisory on Wednesday.
Jim Parsons Reveals He and Husband Todd Spiewak Had Coronavirus, Talks 'Brutal' Symptom
Jim Parsons was one of the millions of people around the world to contract the coronavirus.
The 47-year-old Boys in the Bandstar revealed on Monday's The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon that he and his husband, Todd Spiewak, fought the disease earlier this year.
"Not everybody did [know we had it], but I figure why not talk about it with you on television?"
he quipped to host Fallon.
"Todd and I both had it early on.
It was, like, middle of March.
We didn't know what it was.
We thought we had colds.
And then it seemed less likely and then finally we lost our sense of smell and taste.
"
He said that losing his taste and smell was a particularly tough symptom to have in quarantine.
"It defied the descriptions for me.
I didn't realize how completely taste and smell could be gone," he said.
"And when you're in quarantine and there's really nothing to do but eat,
oh my god, that was brutal.
"
When Fallon asked if that meant he abstained from eating while suffering from that particular symptom, Parsons replied, "I ate everything.
I just didn't taste it.
It's the definition of wasted calories.
"
Prior to the pandemic, the actor wrapped a lengthy run as Sheldon Cooper on The Big Bang Theory.
"Yeah, it was weird," he said of the show ending.
"It's been really hard to decide what is Big Bang being gone and what's being now stuck in this weird time of quarantine.
The whole world is in this weird time.
The weirdest part for me was the way -- and I'm sorry if this sounds morbid -- but it reminds me of when someone dies or a pet passes and it feels so monumental in the moment and you think, well, this will never end.
And then one day you look up and you go, 'Oh, nine months have gone by.
OK, I guess life carries on.'
"
As for how his famous character would handle quarantine, Parsons quipped, "He was built for this.
This was the moment he was waiting for."
CNA asked some medical professionals how people can manage such post-COVID symptoms:
COUGH AND WHEEZING
Physiotherapist Jaclyn Chow said that inflammation in the cells infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus can persist even after one tests negative, leading to lingering symptoms like a cough, airway sensitivity and discomfort in the upper respiratory tract.
If the cough is leading to sleeplessness or discomfort, cough medication can help to relieve the symptom.
Pharmacists or doctors can recommend the appropriate medicine based on the cause of the cough, its duration and other clinical signs such as fever or muscle ache, said community pharmacist Shawn Lee.
In most cases, cough mixtures given at the clinic are similar to what is sold at retail pharmacies, said Mr Lee, a member of the Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore.
But note that these medicines do not cure the viral infection, he added.
If the patient coughs more when lying down, it could be caused by watery mucus dripping down the back of the throat.
In such cases, consider sleeping with an additional pillow to prop up the head or take an antihistamine, which is typically used for runny nose.
BREATHLESSNESS
A good way to manage breathlessness is to make sure one is breathing well.
Ms Chow said that some people develop a different breathing pattern after COVID-19, and start breathing with their mouth as their nose was blocked.
But breathing through the nose warms and moistens the air, while air breathed through the mouth can be “more of an irritant”.
Breathing through the nose also produces nitric oxide, which opens up the airways.
For people who are mouth breathers, she will first train them to go back to nasal breathing.
She will also make sure that they are breathing using their diaphragm rather than their upper chest.
Diaphragmatic breathing is more efficient and leads to less fatigue, she said.
Posture is important as hunching limits the flexibility of one’s chest walls, and one’s breathing capacity.
Chest stretches can help with this.
Improving posture can add up to 50ml of air per breath, or about 10 per cent of one’s usual air intake, said Ms Chow.
When patients start breathing better, she recommends exercises to help them regain stamina.
Using one’s muscles increases oxidative capacity, or their ability to use oxygen, she added.
FATIGUE
There can be many factors leading to fatigue but breathing exercises can help some patients deal with this, said Ms Chow.
A patient who breathes at a fast rate lowers the carbon dioxide level in their blood, causing narrowing of airways and blood vessels.
If the level is far too low, it can limit blood flow to the brain causing headaches, fatigue and dizziness.
“We try to slow the breathing rate … so that you can reverse the blood vessels narrowing, the airways narrowing and that helps with the symptoms of fatigue, if the cause is a breathing pattern disorder,” she said.
COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus discovered in late 2019.
Most people who get COVID-19 have mild or moderate symptoms, but some people, especially those with preexisting health conditions, become severely ill.
Constipation isn’t typically a symptom of COVID-19, but it may be in some cases.
Factors like medication, dietary changes, gut bacteria changes, and physical activity changes can all contribute to its development.
Keep reading to learn when constipation may be a symptom of COVID-19 and which digestive symptoms you’re more likely to experience.
Is constipation a symptom of COVID-19?
Constipation isn’t a typical symptom of COVID-19, but COVID-19 may lead to constipation for some people either directly or indirectly.
A case study published in May 2020 described a man with COVID-19 who came to the hospital with a fever, cough, nausea, constipation, and abdominal pain.
A computerized tomography (CT) scan showed that he had colonic ileus, which is when the muscles of the intestines stop contracting.
A study published in June 2020 reported a number of people with COVID-19 were admitted to a hospital in Iran with various gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms including constipation.
Researchers have found that the gut microbiome of people with COVID-19 discharged from the hospital differs from the gut microbiome of the general population.
It’s thought this change may contribute to GI symptoms.
In a February 2021 study , researchers examined the effects of a fecal microbiota transplantation on a group of 11 people with COVID-19 discharged from the hospital with GI symptoms.
Three of the people had constipation.
A fecal microbiota transplantation is a procedure that involves the transfer of healthy bacteria into the intestines.
All three people with constipation saw improvements in symptoms after the procedure.
Medications that lead to constipation Some drugs used to treat COVID-19 may also lead to constipation.
In a 2021 study , researchers examined potential therapies for treating COVID-19.
They listed constipation as a side effect of the drugs famotidine and bevacizumab.
In a May 2020 study , researchers found that 14 percent of people treated with the antiviral drug remdesivir developed constipation.
The medications lopinavir , ribavirin, and some immunomodulatory drugs may also cause constipation in people with COVID-19.
Constipation from stress and anxiety Increased stress and anxiety may increase constipation in people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
In a March 2021 study published in the Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology, 44 percent of a group of people with IBS and either anxiety or depression reported an increase in constipation.
The increase was attributed to psychological distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and not a COVID-19 infection.
What is quarantine constipation?
Although COVID-19 doesn’t typically cause constipation, other factors related to the infection may indirectly cause it.
A lack of physical activity from stay-at-home orders and quarantines can lead to what has become known as “quarantine constipation.”
When you stop being active or reduce your activity, your bowels don’t push stools through as efficiently.
Increased time spent sitting may also compress your colon and contribute to constipation.
Changes in your diet, increased stress levels, and changes in hydration may also all contribute to constipation if you’ve been staying at home more often.
Exercising at home, finding ways to relieve your stress, continuing to eat a healthy diet, and staying hydrated may all help relieve your symptoms.
When to see a doctor Most of the time, mild COVID-19 can be treated at home with plenty of rest and hydration.
It’s important to isolate yourself from other people as soon as possible for 10 days to avoid passing the virus to others.
If you aren’t having a medical emergency, consider that many clinics and doctors office allow you to communicate with a doctor by phone or online.
Medical emergency Call 911 and let the dispatcher know your symptoms, or go to the nearest emergency room if you have the following symptoms, which the CDC lists as an emergency : trouble breathing
persistent pain or pressure in your chest
new confusion
an inability to wake up or stay awake
pale, gray, or blue colored skin, lips, or nails
anything else unusual or concerning
The World Health Organization says it strongly recommends that people with mild or moderate COVID-19 illness at risk for hospitalization take the antiviral Paxlovid.
The news comes as more instances of recurring symptoms are being reported after taking the drug.
Pfizer’s course of oral pills containing ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir should be considered for patients with nonsevere illness who are unvaccinated, elderly or immunocompromised, the WHO announced Friday.
In these cases, WHO favors Paxlovid over remdesivir, Merck’s antiviral pill molnupiravir and COVID-19 monoclonal antibody treatments, the Agence France-Presse reported.
In the United States, the federal COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel also recommends that vulnerable patients with nonsevere illness be treated with Paxlovid.
The drug should be initiated within five days of symptom onset, according to the Food and Drug Administration.
The FDA authorized Paxlovid in December for emergency use during the pandemic.
The authorization pleased clinicians.
In clinical trials, the drug reduced the rate of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 by nearly 90%.
And it was one of the first COVID-19 treatments that did not require intravenous infusion.
Remedesivir, also a highly effective antiviral, requires intravenous infusion.
Molnupiravir, meanwhile, is less effective than Paxlovid.
Symptoms rebound after treatment
But concerns have recently been raised by about a phenomenon that may follow use of Paxlovid.
In a flurry of social media posts, patients and clinicians have reported an odd turn of events affecting some of those who are treated with the medication, according to the Boston Globe.
Many describe taking a five-day course of the drug and testing negative for SAR-CoV-2 infection, only to experience a return of symptoms and sometimes a new positive result on a COVID-19 test.
Scientists are still trading theories about why this is happening, but some clinicians and scientists have expressed concern that these patients may still be infected and transmitting the disease.
“If you are testing positive on a rapid antigen test, then you have a decent amount of virus and likely an infectious amount of virus,” one infectious disease expert told the news outlet.
About 20% of people suffer from dry eye disease due to a COVID-19 infection
Researchers recently discovered that about 20% of people infected by the novel coronavirus end up with dry eye disease.
Why it matters: The dry eye COVID-19 symptom joins a growing list of various coronavirus symptoms someone can experience after infection.
Driving the news: A new study from the Chinese University of Hong Kong found that the risk of dry eye disease (DED) can increase for those who were infected by the coronavirus.
What they found: Researchers reviewed 228 cases of recovered COVID-19 patients from one to three months after infection and compared those records to 109 healthy people, per the South China Morning Post.
Scientists found that patients who had COVID-19 had a higher risk for eye disease.
In fact, about 21.5% of patients had one sign of developing the condition.
Symptoms: The most common COVID-19 symptom was blurred vision, followed by itching, pain and burning sensations, per South China Morning Post.
Tearing, discharge and redness were also mentioned among the top symptoms.
Other symptoms included “grittiness, light sensitivity and lid swelling,” but these were the least common symptoms, according to South China Morning Post.
Flashback: Dr. Nina Aslam, a general practitioner who works for Goldeneye Eye Care in the United Kingdom, told The Express back in January that the omicron variant often caused conjunctivitis — or pinkeye — in patients.
Some symptoms the same, others different
Over the last week, many kids living in southern British Columbia have woken up to orange, smoggy skies from wildfires burning on the west coast of the United States.
As of Tuesday, that smoke was blowing east into at least four other Canadian provinces, covering parts of Alberta and making its way as far as Toronto.
And although the smoke is expected to start to clear up by the end of the week, air quality remains poor in some areas — particularly in B.C., where it’s been rated some of the worst in the world.
Because wildfire smoke can cause respiratory issues, you may be wondering how to tell the difference between smoke-related symptoms and those caused by COVID-19.
Are my symptoms from COVID or the smoke?
Sarah Henderson, a senior environmental health scientist at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, says that fever, body aches and chills are expected with COVID-19, but not wildfire smoke.
Health scientist Sarah Henderson recommends that those living in smoky areas wear masks and avoid the outdoors and excessive exercise.

However, both can cause dry cough, sore throat, runny nose and headaches.
Either way, Henderson said that if you’re having difficulty breathing, it’s a medical emergency and you should call 911.
Will my mask protect me from smoke?
Masks can protect you from smoke, but they need to be fitted properly in order to be effective, Henderson said.
There shouldn’t be any gaps between the mask and your face.
She added that the best kind of cloth mask to protect against smoke is one with tightly woven cotton and a layer of silk.
But any mask with a double layer will provide some protection, Henderson said.

COVID- 19 newest symptom: Sore eyes
MANILA, Philippines — Sore eyes or conjunctivitis is one of the new symptoms of COVID-19.
“Apart from having sore throat, runny nose and headache, there are also some (patients) in other countries that were observed to manifest sore eyes as well,” said Dr. Rontgene Solante, vice president of the Philippine College of Physicians, when asked about the symptoms of the COVID-19 subvariant XBB.1.16, at a public briefing Friday.
The infectious diseases expert added, “We can see from available data that those who get sick with sore eyes also have sore throat, slight fever and cough.
These are symptoms that you won’t see from those suffering from conjunctivitis alone.
This is a constellation of symptoms that includes sore eyes.”
Conjunctivitis or sore eyes is also referred to as “pink eye” wherein pink or red color is observed in the white of the eye area as a result of inflammation of the tissues lining the eyelid (conjunctiva) caused by allergens, bacteria or viruses.
He also noted that based on the WHO classification, the XBB.1.16 or Arcturus has a growth advantage.
“This means people can easily get infected with this because of the mutations in the spike protein, therefore it is highly transmissible,” Solante said.
He added, “Even those who are already vaccinated can be infected.
That is why in some countries that already have XBB.1.16 cases, there has also been a slight increase in (COVID-19) cases.”
“But the important thing is that in those countries where cases of XBB.1.16 have been recorded, there were no signals that this virus or this variant of interest can cause severe COVID.
So, most of the cases are only mild,” Solante said.
He advised the public that when experiencing these symptoms, it is important that they isolate themselves and just stay at home.
“They also have to wash their hands.
And every time they touch their face or eyes, they should not be touching other people because that is another means of transmitting it (virus) to another individual,” Solante said.
At the same time, he pointed out that this slight increase in COVID-19 cases in the country are driven by the XBB sublineage of Omicron.
“Whether it’s the XBB.1.5 or the XBB.1.9.1 or the XBB.1.16 – these are all variants of interest and there is always a possibility that they can cause increase in the cases among our population,” Solante said.
He advised the public, especially the vulnerable population, to keep on wearing face masks.
“As long as there are these variants of interest, we will continue to encourage people to wear their face mask, particularly the vulnerable population – the 65 years old and above, those with comorbidities and the immunocompromised,” he said.
Solante added that “encouraging people to wear face masks instead of making it mandatory means that we are teaching them how to make that particular decision on how to protect ourselves.”
“It is not that every time there is a spike in COVID-19 cases, we have to make a recommendation of this mandatory use of face masks.
We need to live with the virus and knowing how to live with the virus will make us responsible on how not to get the infection by following the health protocols,” Solante said.
Covid tongue is said to be a new symptom of coronavirus, and is added to a long list of oral symptoms of the novel coronavirus infection.
Looks like coronavirus doesn’t just affect our lungs but also our mouth.
We say this because symptoms which seemed strange at first, like the loss of taste or Covid tongue, are becoming fairly common.
In fact, a study reported that around 25 per cent of the patients diagnosed with coronavirus had symptoms related to the oral area.
According to a research letter published in the British Journal of Dermatology, there are many patients who have reported the development of bumps on their tongue.
These bumps are accompanied by inflammation and swelling in the region.
But, what really causes this Covid tongue?
Well, it’s the receptors present on your tongue.
Basically, our body has ACE receptors which are found in abundance on the tongue.
So, when we are hit by the virus, our body defends itself this way.
The tongue getting affected isn’t unique to coronavirus and has been reported by those suffering from other viral infections as well.
It is, however, gaining more recognition as a symptom due to now being associated with the widely-discussed coronavirus.
Apart from Covid tongue, here are 4 oral manifestations of COVID-19
1.
First and foremost, it’s the loss of taste which is the most common oral symptom that the majority of the patients report.
In fact, some individuals reported that this particular symptom was experienced by them even after testing negative for the novel virus.
2.
The second one is bruxism.
This means grinding the teeth and can also be experienced due to stress.
According to an article published in The New York Times, it’s causing more serious issues such as cracked teeth and fractures.
3.
Bleeding and oral inflammation is increasingly being reported by those diagnosed with coronavirus.
4.
Another symptom that is common when suffering from coronavirus is experiencing cotton mouth or dry mouth.
Now, this could be due to various reasons.
Those who have coronavirus might find it hard to breathe and perform the function through their mouth.
This makes the mouth dry.
Coronavirus also interferes with the function of salivary glands, causing dry mouth.
According to experts, this novel virus attacks our salivary glands and reduces the production of saliva.
So, stay alert about any such changes.
If you’ve been experiencing any of the oral health-related symptoms mentioned here, you should talk to a doctor at the earliest.

How Long Do COVID GI Symptoms Last?
The GI symptoms related to COVID vary in how long they last.
For example, research indicated that diarrhea started one to eight days after initial COVID infections and lasted from two to six days afterward.
Additionally, some GI symptoms may persist as part of long COVID.
Long COVID refers to new, returning, or recurring symptoms related to the COVID infection that last longer than 12 weeks after the initial infection.
Long COVID GI symptoms can include diarrhea, nausea, stomach pain, and vomiting.
When To Contact a Healthcare Provider
A stomach bug does not require medical attention in most cases.
Also, you'll want to get tested for COVID if you have any symptoms of the infection and isolate until you have your test results.
However, seek immediate medical attention if you have risk factors (e.g., a weakened immune system) for having serious illness or if you experience life-threatening symptoms, such as:
Chest pain
Difficulty breathing
Discolored lips, nails, or skin
Inability to keep food or fluids down
New or worsening confusion
Problems with wakefulness (staying awake or waking up)
Severe signs of dehydration, like rapid heartbeat and breathing
A Quick Review
Because COVID shares symptoms with the stomach flu, it can be difficult to tell which illness you have.
However, stomach flu consists mainly of GI symptoms like diarrhea and vomiting without other symptoms like chills or chest pains.
Stomach pain, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting can persist if a person has them as part of a COVID infection.
However, see a healthcare provider if you have warning signs during a COVID infection or life-threatening symptoms, like severe dehydration.
